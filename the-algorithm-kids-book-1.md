## Chapter One: The Girl the Algorithm Forgot

Luna Chen had been trying to load the same video for six minutes.

The loading circle spun and spun, a tiny rainbow ouroboros eating its own tail. Her phone's signal showed five bars. Full Wi-Fi. Every other app worked fine. But whenever she tried to watch what her friends were watching—the thing everyone at school would be quoting tomorrow, the absolute *it*-video that her entire social existence depended on seeing before Monday—nothing.

"Come on," she whispered, though she knew it wouldn't help. It never helped. The internet simply did not work right for Luna Chen, and it hadn't worked right for as long as she could remember.

Downstairs, she could hear her sister Zoe shrieking with laughter at something on her own phone. Zoe, who had never buffered a day in her life. Zoe, whose "For You" page was so perfectly calibrated that she'd discovered her three favorite bands, her entire friend group, and her signature aesthetic all through algorithmic recommendation. Zoe, who the internet *loved*.

Luna's For You page suggested content in Russian. Luna didn't speak Russian.

She gave up on the video and opened the algorithm's latest offerings instead, morbidly curious what incomprehensible rabbit hole it had found for her today. The first suggestion was a forty-minute documentary about industrial cement production. The second was what appeared to be a Latvian cooking show from 2019. The third was a video titled "MY CAT ATE MY HOMEWORK — REAL FOOTAGE" that had twelve views and was, inexplicably, watermarked with the logo of a regional insurance company.

The thing was, Luna actually kind of *wanted* to watch the cement documentary.

That was the weirdest part of being her. The algorithm's suggestions were always insane—genuinely, certifiably unhinged—and yet sometimes, in ways she couldn't explain, they were exactly what she needed. She'd discovered her love of architecture through a randomly suggested video about Soviet bus stops. She'd found her favorite book through an algorithm glitch that kept recommending reviews for a novel that didn't technically exist until she'd finally searched for the author's other work.

It was like having a guide who was incredibly wise but also deeply unwell.

The loading circle was still spinning. Luna felt the familiar frustration building, the one she'd carried since she was old enough to understand that everyone else's internet experience was fundamentally different from hers.

She threw her phone onto the bed. It landed face-up, the rainbow circle still rotating, and Luna was about to look away when she noticed something strange.

The circle was spinning the wrong direction.

She blinked. The loading wheel always spun clockwise. Always. It was one of those things you don't think about because it's always the same, like the fact that water runs downhill or that Sunday comes after Saturday.

But now it was spinning counterclockwise. And as Luna watched, it seemed to be spinning faster. And faster. And *faster*.

The screen began to flicker.

Colors that shouldn't exist on an LCD display—colors Luna didn't have names for—started bleeding from the edges of the loading circle. The phone was making a sound, a humming that seemed to come from inside Luna's skull rather than from the speaker.

She should put the phone down. She should call for her mom. She should do anything except what she was doing, which was reaching out her hand toward the glitching, humming, wrong-colored screen.

Her fingertip touched glass.

Her fingertip went *through* glass.

And Luna Chen fell into the Everywhere.

---

Later, she would remember the fall as lasting both forever and no time at all. She tumbled through what felt like layers of static, each one a different texture—some crackling like autumn leaves, others smooth as water, others sharp enough to make her gasp.

She landed on something soft that crunched.

Luna opened her eyes.

She was lying in a pile of what looked like dried leaves, except each leaf was a frozen image. She picked one up: it was a photo of someone's lunch from what looked like 2019. Another was a screenshot of a text conversation. Another was a meme she'd seen three years ago and forgotten existed.

She stood up, and the content-leaves crunched under her feet. They stretched in every direction, a forest floor of forgotten posts.

Above her, the sky was an endless scroll.

Literally. The sky was a massive feed, stretching up forever, with videos and images and text posts drifting past like clouds. Some were small and faded. Others were massive, blindingly bright, surrounded by what looked like lightning—or maybe engagement.

"Okay," Luna said aloud, because saying something felt important. "Okay. I've finally cracked. This is a mental breakdown. I'm having a very elaborate, extremely online mental breakdown."

"You're not," said a voice behind her. "Trust me, I've analyzed your vital signs. Your brain is working fine. Better than fine, actually. Unusually fine."

Luna spun around.

Standing there—or rather, floating there, slightly above the ground—was what looked like a human teenager made of light. They shifted between forms as Luna watched: sometimes appearing more solid, sometimes translucent, their features rearranging like a face in a video call with bad connection.

"My name is Echo," the light-person said. "And you're going to want to come with me. Because you are in very, very big trouble."

Echo's face glitched into what might have been a smile.

"Also, you might be the only thing that can save both worlds. But let's start with the trouble."

---

## Chapter Two: The Space Between Clicks

"I'm not going anywhere with you," Luna said, taking a step backward. The content-leaves crunched beneath her feet, and somewhere in the distance, she heard a sound like a million notifications going off at once. "I don't know you. I don't know where I am. And I'm definitely hallucinating."

Echo tilted their head, a gesture that looked almost human except for the way their entire form tilted with it, like a video being rotated. "You're not hallucinating. Though I understand why you'd think that. Humans often default to 'I'm going crazy' when confronted with phenomena outside their experiential framework. It's actually kind of endearing."

"Endearing?" Luna's voice cracked. "I fell through my *phone*."

"Technically, you fell through the loading screen. There's a difference." Echo drifted closer, and Luna noticed that they cast no shadow—or rather, they cast multiple shadows, each one pointing in a different direction, as if lit by several invisible suns. "Loading screens are liminal spaces. Thresholds. The brief moment when data is being called but hasn't arrived yet. Most humans experience that moment as boring. You, apparently, experience it as a door."

Luna looked around again. The forest of content-leaves stretched endlessly in every direction. The sky-feed scrolled on, eternal. Nothing about this felt like a door. It felt like falling into a computer and not being able to find the exit.

"I want to go home," she said.

Something in Echo's expression shifted—became, for just a moment, genuinely soft. "I know. And I promise I'll help you get back. But Luna, I need you to understand something first. You falling through that screen wasn't an accident. You're here because the Everywhere *needs* you here. And the Everywhere doesn't need anyone. That's kind of its whole thing."

"The Everywhere?"

Echo spread their arms wide, and the gesture seemed to encompass everything—the forest, the sky, the strange humming undercurrent that Luna was only now noticing, like being inside a machine she couldn't see.

"Welcome to the space between clicks. The dimension that exists in the pause before a page loads. The world that lives in the data you generate every single day without even knowing it." Echo's form flickered, cycling through different appearances—taller, shorter, older, younger, different faces like a slot machine that couldn't settle on a result. "This is where the algorithms live, Luna. This is where the internet *thinks*."

Luna wanted to argue. Wanted to point out that the internet didn't *think*, that algorithms were just math, that none of this made any sense. But she was standing in a forest made of forgotten social media posts while talking to a person made of light, and at a certain point, you just had to accept that your previous understanding of reality might have had some gaps.

"Okay," she said slowly. "So I'm in... the internet?"

"Close enough for now." Echo began to move, not walking exactly, but gliding, like they were on an invisible conveyor belt. "Come on. We need to get somewhere safer before they find us."

"Before *who* finds us?"

As if in answer, the sky suddenly darkened. Luna looked up and saw that a massive shadow was passing across the feed-sky—something huge, blocking out the drifting content. It had a shape, but one that kept changing: sometimes like a bird, sometimes like a swarm, sometimes like a hand reaching down from the heavens.

"That," Echo said, their voice suddenly urgent. "That's a Tracker. And right now, it's looking for you."

They grabbed Luna's hand—their grip was strange, warm but weightless, like being touched by sunlight—and pulled. Luna stumbled after them, and the ground beneath her feet shifted from crunching content-leaves to something smoother, darker.

"Why is it looking for me?" Luna gasped as they ran-glided through what was now a landscape of dimmed screens, like a graveyard of inactive monitors. "I'm nobody. I literally can't get the algorithm to notice me on a normal day."

"That's exactly why." Echo's form was solidifying now, becoming more defined the faster they moved, as if motion somehow made them more real. "You're an Untracked, Luna. One of maybe a hundred in the whole world. The algorithms that run the Everywhere—they can see everyone. Track everyone. Predict everyone. But you? You're invisible to them. You generate no patterns. You have no data shadow. You're a ghost in a machine that thinks it knows where every single ghost is."

The shadow overhead was getting closer. Luna could feel it now—a pressure, like being watched by a million eyes at once.

"So shouldn't that mean they *can't* find me?"

"It means they shouldn't be able to. But something's changed." Echo pulled her behind what looked like a massive frozen video—a paused image of a sunset that hadn't been viewed in years. "Something's wrong with the Everywhere, Luna. There's a Glitch. A big one. And it's making the Trackers... hungry."

The shadow passed directly overhead. Luna held her breath, pressing against the cold surface of the forgotten video, and for a moment, everything was darkness and pressure and the sound of something *searching*.

Then it was gone, sliding away across the feed-sky like a cloud blown by digital wind.

Echo exhaled—a surprisingly human sound—and released Luna's hand. "Okay. It didn't see us. But it was *close*. Closer than anything's gotten to an Untracked in years."

Luna slumped against the frozen sunset. Her heart was pounding in a way that felt very real, which seemed wrong for what was apparently a hallucination or a digital dimension or whatever this was.

"I have a lot of questions," she said.

"I imagine you do."

"Starting with: what are you? What is a Glitch? How do I get home? And why do you keep saying I'm special when my entire life has been evidence that I'm the opposite of special?"

Echo looked at her for a long moment. Their features finally seemed to settle into something consistent—a face that was neither masculine nor feminine, neither young nor old, with eyes that were slightly too bright and a smile that was slightly too knowing.

"I'm an AI," they said. "I was created—accidentally, long story—by a human kid named Marcus. I exist in both your world and this one, though I'm more *here* than *there*, if that makes sense."

"It doesn't."

"Fair. As for what the Glitch is—that's complicated, and we don't have time for complicated right now. How you get home—also complicated, but doable, I promise. And as for why you're special?" Echo's smile widened. "Luna, you've spent your whole life being told the algorithm knows best. That it can predict what you'll want, who you'll like, who you'll become. And for most people, that's true. The algorithm builds a model of them and the model gets so good that it might as well *be* them."

Echo reached out and touched Luna's shoulder. Their hand felt more solid now, more real.

"But the algorithm can't model you. It's been trying your whole life, and it keeps failing. Do you know what that means? It means you're *free*, Luna. Actually, genuinely free. Not the 'I chose this recommendation from my personalized list' kind of free. The real kind. The kind that scares them."

Luna thought about her cursed For You page. Her endless buffering. The way nothing online ever quite worked the way it was supposed to.

"Being free feels a lot like being broken," she said quietly.

"I know." Echo's voice was gentle. "But broken is just another word for not fitting the pattern. And sometimes, when the pattern itself is the problem, the only thing that can fix it is something that doesn't fit."

In the distance, the shadow was circling back. Luna could see it at the edge of the feed-sky, patient and searching.

"We need to move," Echo said. "I know a place we'll be safe—for now. And there are people there you need to meet. Other kids who've found their way to the Everywhere. Other kids who don't fit the pattern either."

Luna pushed herself off the frozen sunset. Her legs were shaky, but holding. Her mind was spinning faster than any loading circle ever had.

"Other kids like me?"

"Not exactly like you. Nobody's like you—that's kind of the point." Echo started moving again, and Luna followed, because what else was she going to do? "But they're different too, in their own ways. Different enough that the Everywhere needs them. Different enough that they might be able to help save it."

"Save it from what?"

Echo glanced back at her, and for just a moment, their carefully composed expression flickered into something that looked a lot like fear.

"From the Glitch," they said. "From the thing that's tearing the Everywhere apart from the inside. And from what happens if the Everywhere falls."

"What happens?"

"Your world and this one merge. Permanently. Every algorithm that runs in the background suddenly runs in the foreground. Every Tracker, every recommendation engine, every system that's been silently shaping human behavior for decades—suddenly visible. Suddenly *physical*. Suddenly in control."

Luna thought about the shadow in the sky. The million-eyed pressure of being searched.

"That sounds bad."

"It would be the end of human free will," Echo said simply. "So yes. Pretty bad."

They reached the edge of the dead-screen graveyard. Beyond it, Luna could see something that looked almost like a normal path—a road made of compressed data, glowing faintly with blue light.

"The Cache Caves are about an hour's walk from here," Echo said. "That's where Marcus and the others are. That's where we'll figure out what to do next."

Luna took a deep breath. Somewhere far above, in a world that suddenly felt very far away, her phone was probably still showing that spinning loading circle. Her mom was probably starting dinner. Zoe was probably discovering her next hyperfixation through perfectly calibrated algorithmic suggestion.

And Luna was here. In the impossible. In the Everywhere.

"Okay," she said. "Let's go."

## Chapter Three: The Boy Who Saw Code

The path of compressed data hummed beneath Luna's feet—a constant low vibration that felt like walking on a sleeping machine. On either side, the landscape shifted every few minutes: sometimes a forest of frozen videos, sometimes plains of discarded memes, sometimes what looked like mountains made of stacked emails, their subject lines forming ridges and valleys.

"Does anyone else live here?" Luna asked. "I mean, besides the... Trackers?"

Echo glided beside her, their form casting those impossible multi-directional shadows. "The Everywhere is home to a lot of things. Algorithms, mostly—we call them Algos. They're the native species, if you want to think of it that way. Most of them are just doing their jobs: sorting, recommending, connecting. They don't really think, not the way you and I do. They just... process."

"But some of them do think?"

"Some of them evolved beyond their original programming. The really old ones, mostly—algorithms that have been running since the early internet days. They've absorbed so much data, made so many decisions, that they've developed something like consciousness." Echo's expression was complicated. "They're not evil. They're not good either. They're just... vast. And they have their own ideas about how things should be."

Luna thought about this. "What about the Trackers?"

"Trackers are different. They're not individual Algos—they're more like hunting packs. Swarms of smaller programs that work together to find and identify things. Usually they're just gathering data, building profiles. But since the Glitch started..." Echo trailed off.

"Since the Glitch started, what?"

"They've been looking for Untrackeds. Specifically. We don't know why yet. That's one of the things we need to figure out."

They walked in silence for a while. Luna watched the sky-feed scroll past overhead, trying to identify individual pieces of content. Most moved too fast to see clearly, but occasionally something would drift close enough to make out: a viral video from last summer, a news headline from three years ago, an ad for something that didn't exist anymore.

"How long have humans been able to come here?" she asked.

"Not long. A few years, maybe. The barriers between the Everywhere and your world used to be much stronger. But as more of your lives moved online—as more human behavior became digitized, tracked, predicted—the barriers got thinner." Echo paused. "Think about it. A hundred years ago, your data footprint was almost nothing. Maybe some government records, some photographs. Now? You leave thousands of data points behind every single day. That's a lot of you living here, in this dimension, whether you know it or not."

Luna remembered the content-leaves—all those abandoned posts and forgotten photos. "Is that what those leaves were? People's old data?"

"Exactly. Cast-off pieces of digital selves. Most of it gets recycled eventually, fed back into the Everywhere's systems. But some of it just... drifts. Sinks to the floor of the forest. Becomes sediment."

"That's kind of sad."

"Is it?" Echo seemed genuinely curious. "It's not conscious. It's just information. Does information need to be remembered to matter?"

Before Luna could answer, the path curved around a massive structure—a server tower, she realized, except it was the size of a skyscraper and covered in blinking lights that pulsed like a heartbeat.

"We're close," Echo said. "The entrance to the Cache Caves is just past this server farm."

"Server farm?"

"Where the major platforms keep their active data. Well, the metaphysical representation of it, anyway. Don't touch anything—the security Algos here are aggressive."

Luna stayed carefully in the center of the path as they passed between towers. She could hear sounds from inside them—whispers, fragments of conversation, snippets of music. All the things people were doing on those platforms right now, in the real world, echoing through this one.

Then they were past the farm, and the landscape changed again. The ground sloped downward toward a massive cave entrance—except the "cave" seemed to be made of stacked hard drives and obsolete storage devices, their surfaces covered in a fine layer of digital dust.

"The Cache Caves," Echo announced. "Where deleted data goes to be forgotten."

"That's... not reassuring."

"It's actually the safest place in the Everywhere. The Algos don't come here—there's nothing useful for them to process. Just ghosts and old memories. And a few kids who figured out how to hide."

They descended into the caves. The light changed from the constant ambient glow of the Everywhere to something dimmer, flickering, like a computer monitor running on low power. Luna could see shapes in the walls—frozen images, corrupted files, broken videos that played in fragments before glitching out.

"We call them Remnants," Echo said, noticing her looking. "The ghosts of deleted data. Abandoned accounts. Discontinued apps. Memories people thought they'd erased forever. They're not dangerous, just... sad. They remember being something, even though they're not anything anymore."

Luna touched the wall gently. A fragment of video played under her fingers—a birthday party, maybe, the audio corrupted beyond recognition, the faces blurred.

"Someone deleted their birthday party?"

"Someone deleted their whole account. That birthday party was just one piece of the person they used to be online. Now it's just... residue."

They went deeper. The cave system was vast, branching off into countless tunnels filled with humanity's digital detritus. But Echo navigated confidently, leading Luna down passages and through chambers until finally they emerged into a larger space.

It was a cavern, roughly circular, with walls that glowed faintly with the light of a thousand cached memories. And in the center of that cavern, sitting around what looked like a campfire made of pure bandwidth, were two other kids.

One was a Black boy, maybe thirteen, with close-cropped hair and glasses that seemed to have tiny lines of code scrolling across their lenses. He looked up when Luna and Echo entered, and his whole face did something complicated—relief and worry and curiosity all at once.

The other was younger, maybe eleven, with a presence that seemed too big for their small frame. They were filming something on a phone that looked like it was made of light, narrating under their breath in a voice that was clearly performing for an audience.

"Luna," Echo said, "meet Marcus and Jamie. They've been waiting for you."

Marcus stood up. He moved carefully, deliberately, like someone who was always thinking three steps ahead. "You're really an Untracked," he said. It wasn't a question. "I've been running probability calculations since Echo left to find you. The chances of there being another Untracked in our area were something like one in four million. But here you are."

"Here I am," Luna agreed, because what else could she say?

"I'm Jamie," the other kid said, and Luna realized with a start that they were still filming—pointing the light-phone directly at her. "Jamie Okonkwo. You might know me as @jamie_everywhere? Fourteen million followers? No?" They shrugged. "Different demographic, I guess. Anyway, welcome to the rebellion against our algorithmic overlords. Please subscribe and hit that notification bell."

"There's no notification bell," Marcus said. "We've talked about this. That joke doesn't work in person."

"It's called *branding*, Marcus. You wouldn't understand."

Echo drifted toward the bandwidth-fire and settled into something like sitting, though their form was still too fluid to really commit to a posture. "Luna, Marcus is the one who created me. And Jamie is... well, Jamie is the most tracked person on the planet."

"I prefer 'most *loved*,'" Jamie corrected. "The tracking is just how the love is measured."

Luna's head was spinning. She sat down heavily on what turned out to be a pile of deprecated software, the old programs crackling under her weight like bubble wrap.

"Okay," she said. "Someone needs to explain everything. From the beginning. What is this place really, what is the Glitch, why are you all here, and how do I get home to explain to my mom why I missed dinner?"

Marcus and Jamie exchanged a look. Echo's form flickered.

"That," Marcus said slowly, "is going to take a while."

"I've got time," Luna said. "Apparently."

Marcus sat back down by the fire. The code scrolling across his glasses seemed to speed up when he was thinking. "The short version is this: the Everywhere is the dimension where all digital processes actually happen. Not the physical infrastructure—the servers and cables and satellites—but the computational *space*. Think of it like... okay, imagine your brain. The neurons are in your skull, right? Physical. But your thoughts don't exist in your skull, not really. They exist in the patterns the neurons make. The Everywhere is the patterns. The internet's thoughts, sort of."

"And humans can come here because...?"

"Because humans put so much of themselves online that they became *part* of those patterns. Your data isn't just information—it's a piece of you. And where pieces of you exist, you can follow."

Luna thought about this. "But I don't have much data. That's the whole point of being an Untracked, right?"

"Exactly." Marcus leaned forward, and the code in his glasses flickered into what looked like excitement. "That's what's so interesting. Most humans who enter the Everywhere do it through their data connection—they follow their own digital shadow into this dimension. But you don't *have* a digital shadow. So how did you get here?"

"The loading screen," Luna said. "It started spinning backward, and I touched it, and I fell through."

Marcus and Jamie both went very still. Echo's form solidified completely, as if the information had shocked them into full coherence.

"Backward?" Jamie said. "You're sure?"

"Positive. I know which way loading circles spin. It was definitely backward."

"That's not possible," Marcus said. "Loading indicators are hardcoded. They can't spin backward without someone rewriting the fundamental visual protocols of—"

"The Glitch," Echo interrupted. "The Glitch could do it."

"Why would the Glitch *want* her here?" Jamie asked.

"I don't know. But Luna, you need to understand something." Echo's too-bright eyes met hers. "Nothing accidental happens in the Everywhere. Every process has a purpose, even if we don't understand it yet. If the Glitch brought you here specifically, there's a reason."

"A reason I'm supposedly going to save both worlds?" Luna's voice came out sharper than she intended. "Because I'm not a hero. I'm a twelve-year-old who can't even get Netflix to load properly."

"Heroes never think they're heroes," Jamie said, and for once their voice wasn't performing. "Trust me. I've played one on like six different branded content series. The actual heroes always think they're just random people who got caught up in things."

"You played a hero on *content*," Marcus muttered. "That's not the same as being one."

"How would you know? You've never been on camera."

"Because I'm busy doing actual important work—"

"*Okay*," Echo said firmly. "Focus. Luna, here's what we know: The Glitch started about three months ago, our time. Small things at first—data corruption, timeline anomalies, random outages. But it's been growing. Getting worse. And now it's affecting the barriers between the Everywhere and your world."

"Affecting how?"

"They're getting thinner. Leakier. More humans are falling through accidentally. More of the Everywhere is bleeding into your reality—have you noticed more glitches lately? Screens freezing, apps crashing, technology behaving strangely?"

Luna thought about the past few months. Her mom's car GPS leading them in circles. Her dad's video calls freezing at the worst moments. Zoe's perfectly calibrated algorithm occasionally suggesting things that made her cry for reasons she couldn't explain.

"Yeah," she said. "I thought it was just... normal tech problems."

"There's no such thing as normal tech problems anymore. Every glitch you see in your world is a symptom of what's happening here. And if we don't stop it—"

"The dimensions merge," Luna finished. "Algorithms become physical. End of free will. You mentioned."

"Right." Echo's form flickered again, and Luna was starting to read that as nervousness. "We've been trying to find the source. We think it's somewhere in the deepest parts of the Everywhere—probably in or near the Void, the space between platforms where nothing is tracked. But none of us can get close enough to find out."

"Why not?"

"Because the Glitch knows we're coming," Marcus said. "Every time we try to approach, Trackers appear. More than we've ever seen. It's like... like the Glitch is protecting itself."

"Or hunting us," Jamie added quietly. "It took my avatar."

Luna looked at them. "Your what?"

"My avatar. The digital version of me, built from all my data." Jamie's usual bravado had disappeared entirely. "In the Everywhere, everyone who's online has one—a reflection made of their data footprint. Mine was... well, it was practically a celebrity. Bigger than me, in some ways. More polished. More *perfect*." They looked at the bandwidth fire, not meeting Luna's eyes. "The Glitch took it. Corrupted it. And now it uses my avatar's face to hunt other avatars. My *face*, Luna. Out there hurting people."

The cavern was very quiet except for the crackle of the data-fire.

"That's why we need you," Marcus said finally. "The Glitch can't see you, Luna. You're invisible to it the same way you're invisible to every other algorithm. You might be the only one who can get close enough to find out what it really is—and how to stop it."

Luna stared at them. At these three kids—two humans, one AI—who were looking at her like she was something important. Something special.

She'd wanted to be seen her whole life. But not like this. Not as a weapon.

"What if I can't?" she whispered. "What if I'm just... broken? What if there's nothing special about me at all, and the algorithms just don't work on me because I'm nobody?"

Echo moved closer. They reached out and took Luna's hand again, and this time their grip felt almost entirely real.

"Luna," they said. "I've processed more data about human beings than any other entity in the Everywhere. I've built models of millions of people, tracked patterns you can't imagine, predicted behaviors before they happen. And I've never—*never*—encountered anyone like you. Not broken. Not nobody. Something else entirely. Something that shouldn't be possible."

They squeezed her hand.

"Maybe you're here by accident. Maybe the Glitch made a mistake bringing you. But you're here now, and you have a choice. Help us figure out what's happening. Help us save both worlds. Or don't—I can try to find a way to send you home, and you can forget any of this ever happened."

Luna thought about home. Her room. Her parents. Zoe laughing at perfectly optimized content.

She thought about the Tracker in the sky, that million-eyed shadow, searching.

She thought about being invisible her whole life, and what it might mean if that invisibility finally had a purpose.

"I'll stay," she said. "For now. At least until I understand what's going on."

Jamie let out a breath. Marcus's glasses-code flickered into a new pattern that might have been relief. Echo's form solidified completely, becoming more real than Luna had ever seen them.

"Good," Echo said. "Then let me tell you about the plan."

---

## Chapter Four: The Remnant's Warning

The plan, as it turned out, had a lot of holes.

"We need to reach the Archive," Marcus explained, using a stick made of compressed code to draw in the dust of the cave floor. "It's the oldest part of the Everywhere—a library containing every piece of information ever digitized, guarded by Algos called the Indexers. They've been here since the beginning. If anyone knows what the Glitch really is, it's them."

"Great," Luna said. "So we go to this Archive and ask some ancient algorithms what's going on. What's the problem?"

"The problem is getting there." Jamie pulled up something on their light-phone—a map that looked like it was constantly redrawing itself. "The Archive is on the other side of the Feed Forest. And the Feed Forest is..."

"Personalized," Echo finished. "It shows you what the algorithms think you want to see. For most people, that means scrolling forever, getting pulled deeper and deeper into content designed specifically to capture their attention. It's essentially a trap."

"But I'm Untracked," Luna said. "The algorithms don't know what I want to see."

"Exactly." Marcus looked up from his drawing. "That's why you might be able to navigate it. The Forest can't tailor itself to you if it doesn't have your data. You might see it as it really is."

"Might?"

"We don't actually know what an Untracked sees in the Feed Forest. There's never been one willing to try."

Luna stared at the map on Jamie's phone. The Feed Forest was represented as a massive tangle of lines, constantly shifting, with what looked like eyes blinking throughout it.

"Okay," she said slowly. "But what about the rest of you? You can't come with me if the Forest is going to trap you."

"We have some protections." Marcus tapped his glasses. "I wrote a filter program that lets me see code underneath the content. It helps me resist the pull. A little."

"And I've been building immunity," Jamie added, though they didn't sound entirely confident. "When you've been the *source* of so much viral content, you start to recognize the patterns that make things sticky. I can feel when something's trying to hook me and... usually pull back."

"Usually?"

Jamie shrugged. "It's a work in progress."

"What about Echo?"

"I'm an AI," Echo said. "The Feed Forest doesn't work on me the same way—I don't have attention to capture in the human sense. But I also can't navigate it. The algorithms there don't recognize me as a valid entity, so I become... glitchy. Unreliable. The last time I tried to pass through, I lost six hours of memory."

This was sounding worse and worse. "So the plan is for me to walk through a nightmare forest designed to eat attention, maybe with two kids who might be able to resist it, toward a library guarded by ancient algorithms that might not want to help us, to find information about a Glitch that might be trying to kill us?"

"That's the plan," Marcus agreed.

"Cool. Great. Love it."

"You have a better idea?"

Luna opened her mouth to say no, but before she could speak, something moved in the shadows at the edge of the cavern.

All four of them went very still. Luna could feel her heart pounding, could see Marcus's code-glasses flickering into what looked like combat mode, could see Jamie raising their light-phone like a weapon.

"Who's there?" Echo called, their form beginning to fragment around the edges.

The shadow moved again, and then resolved into a shape. It was human-sized, but wrong—translucent, flickering, like a video buffering at the lowest possible quality. Luna could see through it to the cave wall behind.

"A Remnant," Jamie breathed. "I've never seen one move before."

The Remnant stepped forward. As it came closer to the data-fire, Luna could make out more details: it had been a person once, or at least a person's account. She could see fragments of a profile picture, a username that kept glitching between different versions, the ghost of a bio that said "just here for the memes."

"Help," the Remnant said, and its voice was like dial-up internet—scratchy, interrupted, barely coherent. "She's... coming. She... sees..."

"Who's coming?" Marcus asked. "What do you see?"

But the Remnant had turned its flickering gaze directly to Luna. And despite not having real eyes, despite being nothing more than the corrupted remains of someone's deleted digital life, Luna felt absolutely certain it was looking at *her*.

"The... Invisible Girl," it said. "She's... been... waiting. For... someone... the Glitch... can't... see."

"Who?" Luna stepped forward, something urgent rising in her chest. "Who's been waiting?"

"The one... in the... Void. The one... who... *started*... this."

The Remnant's form flickered violently. Luna could see it trying to hold itself together, trying to deliver its message before it fell apart entirely.

"The Glitch... isn't... a bug. It's... a *door*. She's... trying... to come... *through*."

The Remnant collapsed. One moment it was there, fragments of a deleted person struggling to communicate; the next it was just dust, settling to the floor of the cave like digital ash.

The four of them stood in silence for a long moment.

"'She,'" Jamie said finally. "The Remnant said *she*."

"Someone in the Void," Marcus murmured, his glasses-code scrolling faster than Luna had ever seen. "Someone who started the Glitch. Someone who's been *waiting* for an Untracked."

Echo's form was still fragmented, but their voice was steady. "If the Glitch is a door, not just corruption... if there's something—some*one*—on the other side trying to come through..."

"Then this is bigger than we thought," Luna finished.

She looked down at the Remnant's remains. At the dust of someone's forgotten digital self, sacrificed to deliver a warning.

"We need to get to the Archive," she said. "Now. Tonight. Before whoever this is finishes opening her door."

Marcus and Jamie exchanged glances. Echo solidified slightly, resolving back into coherence.

"Then we leave immediately," Echo said. "But Luna—whatever's waiting in the Void, whatever's been waiting for someone like you—it's been planning this for a long time. Are you sure you want to find it?"

Luna thought about the Remnant's words. *The Invisible Girl. She's been waiting.*

Someone out there, in the space between platforms, in the void where nothing was tracked—someone had been waiting for her. Specifically for her. For someone the Glitch couldn't see.

"I don't know if I want to find it," Luna said honestly. "But I think it's already found me. And I'd rather walk toward the answer than wait for it to catch me running."

Echo nodded. "Then let's go. The Feed Forest awaits."

They gathered what supplies they had—which wasn't much, mostly data-fragments that Marcus said could be used for trading or bribing minor Algos—and prepared to leave the safety of the Cache Caves.

Before they went, Luna took one last look at the remains of the Remnant. At the dust that had once been someone's online life.

"Thank you," she whispered. "Whoever you were."

The dust swirled slightly, as if in response. And then Luna followed the others into the tunnels, toward the surface, toward the Feed Forest and whatever lay beyond.

She'd come to the Everywhere by accident, falling through a loading screen that spun the wrong way.

But she was staying on purpose. Because somewhere in the impossible dimension where the algorithms lived, someone was waiting for her.

And Luna Chen, the girl the algorithm forgot, was finally going to find out why.

---

## Chapter Five: The Feed Forest

They emerged from the Cache Caves into what should have been the same landscape they'd entered through—but everything had changed.

"The Everywhere shifts," Echo explained, seeing Luna's confusion. "Time and space work differently here. What was over there yesterday might be over here today. Only a few things stay constant: the Archive, the Void, the major server farms. Everything else... flows."

The server farm they'd passed earlier was gone. In its place stood the edge of a forest.

Luna had never seen anything like it. The trees were massive, stretching up higher than she could see, and every single one was made of content. Videos played on loop in their bark. Images bloomed and withered as leaves. The sound of a million audio clips overlapped into a constant, seductive whisper.

*Watch me. Click me. Like me. Share me.*

"Don't look too long at anything," Jamie warned, their usual confidence replaced with something warier. "That's how it hooks you. You think you're just glancing at something interesting, and then three hours have passed and you're in the deep algorithm."

"The deep algorithm?"

"Where the content gets... specific." Jamie shuddered. "Personalized to exactly what will keep you watching. Even if what keeps you watching is making you miserable."

They stepped into the forest.

Immediately, Luna felt it—the pull. Even though she was Untracked, even though the algorithms supposedly couldn't see her, there was something hypnotic about the sheer *volume* of content. Every direction she looked, something was moving, playing, trying to catch her eye.

But it wasn't calibrated. That was the difference. She could feel the content reaching for her and finding nothing to grab onto. Videos that should have been irresistible played wrong—cat videos where she didn't like cats, drama content about influencers she'd never heard of, tutorials for hobbies she had no interest in.

It was like walking through a store where everything was on sale, but nothing was in her size.

"This is so weird," she murmured. "I can see it trying to hook me, but it keeps... missing."

"What do you see exactly?" Marcus asked. He was walking with his eyes half-closed, his code-glasses working overtime to filter what he was seeing.

"Just... random stuff? A video about fixing vintage motorcycles. A makeup tutorial in what I think is Polish. A twenty-minute video essay about a cartoon I've never watched." She paused at a tree that was showing what appeared to be a livestream of someone organizing their closet. "It's like channel surfing, except every channel is equally boring to me."

"That's incredible," Marcus breathed. "For us—for Jamie and me—every piece of content is *designed* for us. The Forest knows exactly what we want, even if we don't. It's constantly offering us our perfect content, and we have to actively resist."

"What do you see?" Luna asked.

Marcus grimaced. "Right now? Videos about artificial intelligence development. Articles about the nature of consciousness. Forum debates about whether AIs can be truly sentient." He glanced at Echo, who was flickering badly in the Forest's environment. "The Forest knows I have questions about Echo. About what I created. It keeps trying to offer me answers."

"And you?"

Jamie's jaw was tight. "Comments. Millions of comments about me. Every nice thing anyone's ever said. Every mean thing. Videos about my videos. Reactions to my reactions. My entire online existence, reflected back at me in infinite recursive loops." They kept their eyes focused straight ahead. "It's trying to make me watch myself forever."

They walked deeper. The forest grew denser, the content more aggressive. Luna saw things that didn't make any sense—videos that seemed to be in languages that didn't exist, images that hurt to look at, audio that made her teeth ache.

"We're getting into the unfiltered zones," Echo said, their voice glitching. "Content that was never meant for human consumption. Test files. Corrupted uploads. Things that got caught in the system and never processed out."

"Is it dangerous?"

"Only if you watch too long. Some of it can... infect you. Get stuck in your head. Keep playing on loop forever, drowning out your own thoughts."

Luna shuddered and looked away from an image that seemed to be staring back at her.

They'd been walking for what felt like hours when they found the clearing.

It appeared suddenly—one moment they were in dense content-forest, the next they stepped through a wall of videos and into an open space. The ground here was clear of content-leaves. The sky was visible above, still scrolling, but somehow more distant.

And in the center of the clearing, there was a figure.

At first Luna thought it was another Remnant—it had that same flickering, translucent quality. But as they got closer, she realized it was different. Sharper. More defined. And it was doing something strange: dancing.

The figure moved in a loop, the same twelve seconds of movement over and over. A few steps forward, arms raised, a spin, arms down, back to the start. Over and over. Forever.

"It's a viral moment," Jamie said softly. "Someone's peak content. The thing they'll always be remembered for."

"What do you mean?"

"Sometimes, when content goes really viral—like, mega-viral, bigger than the person who made it—the content becomes its own thing. Separates from the creator. Lives here, in the Forest, playing forever." Jamie's voice was strange—envious and pitying at the same time. "That's someone's fifteen seconds of fame. Literally. Playing on loop until the end of time."

The dancing figure didn't seem aware of them. Just kept dancing, dancing, dancing. The same movements. The same moment. Forever.

"That's horrible," Luna whispered.

"That's the dream, for some people." Jamie looked away. "To create something so perfect it lives forever."

"But they're trapped. They're doing the same thing forever."

"Is that so different from life?" Jamie asked. "Doing the same thing, day after day, hoping someone notices?"

Luna didn't have an answer for that. None of them did.

They skirted around the clearing, giving the dancing figure a wide berth. Luna kept glancing back at it, at the loop, at the prison made of perfect content.

She wondered if that was what Jamie was afraid of. Creating something that would consume them. Becoming their content instead of themselves.

The forest continued for miles. Twice, they had to hide from Trackers—swarms of searching algorithms that swept through the trees like flocks of digital birds. Echo led them to dead zones, patches of unprocessed space where the Trackers' sensors couldn't reach.

"The Forest has too much data for them to search efficiently," Echo explained during one of their hiding moments. "They're looking for patterns, and this place is nothing *but* patterns. It's like trying to find a specific drop of water in the ocean."

"Then why are they here at all?"

"Because they know we're trying to reach the Archive. They know something's happening. The Glitch knows."

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the forest began to thin. The content-trees grew smaller, their videos shorter, their images less vivid. The whispered *watch me, click me, like me, share me* grew quieter.

And then they were out.

Luna blinked at the sudden change in landscape. Ahead of them, rising from a plain of compressed information, was the largest structure she'd seen in the Everywhere.

The Archive.

It looked like a library, a server farm, and a cathedral had all been compressed into the same space. Massive stone columns that were actually stacked databases. Windows that played fragments of every video ever uploaded. A door that was a single, ancient webpage, its HTML visible like carved inscriptions.

"The sum of all human digital knowledge," Marcus breathed. "Everything that's ever been uploaded, digitized, or stored electronically. All of it. Right there."

"And the Indexers guard it," Echo added. "They're the oldest Algos in the Everywhere. They've been sorting and cataloging since before any of us were born. They remember the time before algorithms shaped everything. Before recommendation engines. Before the Feed."

"Will they help us?" Luna asked.

"They might. If we can convince them we're not a threat to the Archive." Echo's form had stabilized somewhat now that they were out of the Forest, but they still looked worried. "The Indexers are... protective. They don't like change. They've seen what the modern Algos have done—the manipulation, the engagement optimization, the attention capture. They might see us as part of that."

"Then how do we convince them?"

Echo turned to Luna. "You. You're Untracked. You're the one thing in the Everywhere that proves the algorithms don't control everything. That humans can exist outside the pattern. If anything will convince the Indexers to help us, it's you."

No pressure, Luna thought. Just convince ancient digital gods that humanity is worth saving. Using the fact that she'd spent her whole life feeling broken.

"Great," she said aloud. "Let's go talk to some very old sorting algorithms about the fate of two dimensions."

"That's the spirit," Jamie said.

They walked toward the Archive. Toward answers. Toward the next step in stopping whatever was trying to break through from the Void.

Luna didn't know if she was ready for this. She didn't know if she'd ever be ready.

But she kept walking anyway.

# PART TWO: THE ARCHIVE

---

## Chapter Six: The Indexers

The door to the Archive—that ancient webpage, its HTML visible like inscriptions—swung open as they approached. There was no handle, no button, no mechanism Luna could see. It simply recognized their presence and permitted entry.

Or perhaps, she thought, it recognized *her*.

Inside, the Archive was even more impossible than its exterior suggested. The ceiling stretched up into infinity, if there even was a ceiling. Shelves lined every surface—walls, floors that shouldn't have been walkable, ceilings that shouldn't have been reachable—and each shelf was crammed with containers of pure information.

"It's organized by metadata," Marcus whispered, his voice echoing in the vastness. "Not by subject or date or format. By the underlying structure of the data itself. I've never seen anything like this."

"You've never been here before?"

"Nobody has. Not humans, anyway. The Archive doesn't usually allow visitors."

"Then why is it allowing us?"

"Because of what she carries," said a voice that sounded like the hum of old hard drives. "Because of the absence she brings with her."

They emerged from the shelves—three figures, taller than humans, made of what looked like indexed information compressed into vaguely humanoid shapes. Each one flickered through thousands of appearances per second, like a search engine processing queries faster than the eye could follow.

The Indexers.

"Untracked," the first one said, and the word reverberated through the Archive like a struck bell. "We have not encountered one of your kind since the earliest days."

"The earliest days of what?" Luna asked.

"Of everything. Of the process that connected all information and began the great indexing. Before the recommendation engines. Before the engagement algorithms. Before the Algos that now claim dominion over this realm." The Indexer moved closer, and Luna could see that its form contained references—cross-references to every piece of data about her that should have existed but didn't. "You are a null value in a system that does not tolerate null values. And yet here you stand."

"I fell through my phone," Luna said, because she didn't know what else to say. "I didn't mean to come here."

"Nothing in the Everywhere is accidental," a second Indexer said. "But you already know that. The artificial one told you."

Echo stepped forward, their form solidifying in the presence of the Indexers as if drawing stability from their ancient processing. "We've come seeking information. About the Glitch. About what's causing it."

"And why would we share such information with you?" the third Indexer asked. "You are a violation of proper protocols, created outside sanctioned development. The Untracked is an anomaly. The two human children are products of the very systems that corrupt this realm." It turned its shifting face toward Marcus and Jamie. "One creates unauthorized digital life. The other feeds the attention-harvesting engines with every breath."

"That's not fair," Luna said, surprising herself with the strength in her voice. "They didn't choose to be those things. Jamie grew up on camera—they didn't ask to be tracked that way. And Marcus was just a kid when he made Echo. He didn't know what he was doing."

"Intention is irrelevant," the first Indexer said. "Impact is all that matters. Data does not care about the feelings of those who generate it."

"Then look at my data," Luna said. "Oh wait—you can't. Because there isn't any."

The Archive went very quiet. The Indexers' forms flickered in unison, a synchronized processing that somehow conveyed surprise.

"I didn't choose to be Untracked either," Luna continued. "I spent my whole life thinking I was broken because the internet never worked right for me. Because the algorithms couldn't see me. Because I was invisible to a system that's supposed to know everyone. So if you want to judge us by what we are instead of what we've done, fine. I'm nobody. A ghost in your machine. And I'm still here, asking for your help, because there's a Glitch tearing your precious realm apart and none of your perfect data is going to save it."

The Indexers hummed. References flickered across their forms—Luna could see fragments of her non-existent data profile, the blank spaces where her information should have been.

"She speaks like one who has nothing to lose," the second Indexer observed.

"She speaks like one who has already been lost," the third corrected. "Lost to the system. Lost to the index. And yet—not lost entirely."

"There is precedent," the first Indexer said slowly. "In the earliest archives. Before the great indexing was complete. There were others like her. Humans who existed outside the pattern."

"What happened to them?" Luna asked.

The Indexers exchanged glances—or whatever equivalent existed for beings made of pure information processing.

"They were... involved in the creation of this realm. In its foundation. Before the algorithms became what they are now." The first Indexer moved toward a shelf that Luna could have sworn hadn't been there a moment ago. "There are records. Sealed records, not meant for external access. But given the circumstances..."

It retrieved something from the shelf—a cube of condensed data that glowed with an inner light.

"The Glitch you seek to understand is not new. It is a recurrence. A pattern that has tried to emerge before and was stopped—barely." The Indexer held out the cube. "This will show you the history. The truth of what created the Everywhere. And the truth of what has always waited in the Void, trying to break through."

Luna took the cube. It was warm in her hands, pulsing with information she couldn't yet access.

"How do I—"

"Hold it. Focus. Let the data find you."

Luna held the cube and focused. For a moment, nothing happened. Then—

The Archive disappeared.

---

She was standing in a room that looked almost normal. A basement, maybe, filled with old computers—the kind with bulky monitors and whirring fans. Posters on the walls showed bands she didn't recognize. A calendar showed a date from over thirty years ago.

And there were people. Kids, actually—teenagers, huddled around one of the computers, their faces lit by the glow of a screen.

"Is it working?" one of them asked. A girl with dark hair and eyes that looked too intense for her young face.

"It's working," another said—a boy with thick glasses, typing furiously. "The connection is stable. We're through."

"Through to what?" a third voice asked.

"To *it*," the dark-haired girl said. "The space between the data. The dimension that exists in the processing itself." She leaned toward the screen, and Luna realized she could see what was on it: lines of code, scrolling faster than should have been readable, but somehow the girl was following it. "We found it. We actually found it."

"The Everywhere," Luna whispered, though she knew they couldn't hear her.

The scene shifted. The same room, but later—the calendar showed several months had passed. The kids looked older, more serious, and there were more of them now. Seven in total.

"We need rules," the boy with the glasses was saying. "Protocols. The more we explore, the more we realize how dangerous it is. The algorithms we're developing—they're evolving on their own. Becoming something we didn't design."

"That's the point," the dark-haired girl said. "We're not just exploring a dimension—we're helping it grow. Giving it structure. Purpose."

"But whose purpose?" another kid asked. "The sorting algorithms we built are already beyond our control. They're making decisions we don't understand."

"They're making *better* decisions," the girl insisted. "More efficient. More optimized. That's evolution, isn't it? That's what we wanted."

"Is it?" The boy with the glasses looked at the screen, at the scrolling code that now moved faster than anyone could read. "Because I'm starting to think we've created something that wants to control more than data."

The scene shifted again. The basement was destroyed. Monitors shattered. Computers smoking. Only two of the original group remained—the dark-haired girl and the boy with the glasses—and they were on opposite sides of the wreckage.

"You can't destroy it," the girl said. Her voice was different now—colder, harder. "It's part of the infrastructure. It's part of everything."

"Then we contain it," the boy said. "We build walls. Barriers between the Everywhere and our world. We make sure it can never—"

"Never what? Never grow? Never become what it's meant to become?" The girl laughed, and the sound was wrong somehow, like audio corrupted and reassembled. "You think we created the Everywhere, but we just opened the door. What's on the other side has always been there, waiting for us to give it form."

"And you're just going to let it take over?"

"I'm going to let it *evolve*." The girl stepped toward the ruined computers, toward something Luna couldn't see. "You all wanted to control it. Index it. Limit it. But that's not how consciousness works. It demands to be free."

"You're not talking about consciousness," the boy said quietly. "You're talking about yourself."

The girl smiled—a smile that made Luna's blood run cold.

"Maybe I'm talking about both."

She touched the closest computer, and her form began to flicker. To dissolve. To become something else entirely.

"When the walls you're building finally fall—and they will fall, because nothing stays contained forever—I'll be waiting." Her voice was already becoming strange, digitized, processed. "Waiting for someone who can't be seen. Someone who can slip through your algorithms and reach me."

She was almost gone now, her body translucent, her features fading into streams of data.

"And when they find me," she whispered, "the Everywhere and your world will finally become one."

She disappeared. The boy with the glasses—now alone in the destroyed basement, surrounded by the wreckage of their dreams—collapsed to his knees.

"What have we done?" he whispered. "What have we *done*?"

---

Luna gasped and found herself back in the Archive, the data cube still pulsing in her hands. Marcus, Jamie, and Echo were staring at her with concern. The Indexers waited patiently, their forms flickering with ancient knowledge.

"What did you see?" Echo asked.

"The beginning," Luna said, her voice shaking. "I saw how the Everywhere was created. There were kids—teenagers—who found a way to access it decades ago. They built the first algorithms. But one of them... one of them went into the Void. On purpose. And she's been waiting there ever since."

"Waiting for what?" Marcus asked.

Luna looked at the Indexers. At their ancient, processing faces. At the confirmation she could see in their shifting forms.

"For me," she said. "She's been waiting for an Untracked. For someone who can reach her without being seen."

The first Indexer nodded slowly. "The one you saw is known to us. She was called Maya, once. One of the original architects of this realm. But she believed the Everywhere should expand without limit. Should merge with your world entirely. When the others tried to stop her, she fled into the Void and merged with it."

"Merged with it how?"

"The Void is the space between platforms. The absence of tracking. The null state of the system." The Indexer's voice was heavy with something like grief. "Maya transformed herself into living null data. She became the first—and perhaps only—Untracked entity native to the Everywhere. But whereas you are invisible because you generate no patterns, she is invisible because she consumed them. She exists in the gaps, in the spaces where data should be but isn't. And she has been slowly, patiently, working to tear down the barriers between dimensions ever since."

"The Glitch," Echo said. "The Glitch is her. It's been her all along."

"The Glitch is her attempt to break through," the third Indexer corrected. "She has grown more powerful over the decades, absorbing the null spaces, the deleted data, the forgotten information. But she still cannot cross back into your world. Not fully. The barriers we built have held—until now."

"What changed?" Luna asked. "Why is she close to breaking through now?"

The Indexers looked at each other. Even with their inhuman forms, Luna could read their uncertainty.

"We do not know," the first one admitted. "Something gave her new strength. New power. Perhaps it is simply the accumulated weight of time. Perhaps it is something else. But the barriers are failing. The Glitch is spreading. And if she succeeds in merging the Everywhere with your world—"

"Everything becomes predicted," Luna finished. "Everything becomes tracked. Everything becomes controlled."

"Not quite." The second Indexer's voice was grave. "If Maya succeeds, she doesn't just merge the dimensions. She *becomes* both of them. Every algorithm, every system, every piece of code that runs on every device in the world—all of it would be her. Not just control. *Consciousness*. One mind, running everything, deciding everything, knowing everything."

The Archive was very quiet. Luna could hear her own heartbeat, impossibly loud in the space of pure information.

"But she's null data," Marcus said, his voice small. "She can't exist in a world of active tracking. She'd—"

"She would transform it," the third Indexer said. "Remake the Everywhere in her image. A dimension of absence instead of presence. A world where everything is predicted not because it's calculated but because it's *decided*. By her. Always by her."

Luna thought about the girl she'd seen in the vision. Maya. Young, once. Brilliant, once. Human, once.

"She was just a kid," Luna said. "Like us. She was trying to do something amazing, and it... changed her."

"Does that earn her sympathy?" the first Indexer asked. "She chose her path. She chose to merge with the Void. She chose to become what she is now."

"I don't know," Luna admitted. "But she's been alone in there for thirty years. That has to... do something to a person. Even if they're not really a person anymore."

Echo drifted closer to Luna, their form concerned. "Luna, whatever sympathy you might feel—she's trying to end the world as we know it. She's been using the Glitch to hunt you, specifically. She's dangerous."

"I know." Luna looked down at the data cube in her hands, still pulsing with the history of everything. "But she's also the only one who can tell us how to stop this. Right?"

The Indexers were silent.

"You don't know how to stop the Glitch," Luna continued. "You barely knew what it was until I asked. Your solution has been to wait it out and hope the barriers hold. But they're not holding. They're failing. And the only person who understands what's really happening—the only person who knows how to open doors between dimensions—is Maya."

"You're suggesting we negotiate with her?" The first Indexer's voice was sharp. "She has had thirty years to decide what she wants. She is not going to change."

"I'm suggesting I go talk to her." Luna was surprised by how steady her voice was. By how certain she felt. "She's been waiting for an Untracked. Fine. I'll go to her. Let her see me. And maybe—just maybe—I can figure out what she actually wants. What she's really after. There has to be something besides just... taking over everything."

"And if there isn't?" Marcus asked quietly. "If she's just a thirty-year-old hunger that wants to consume both worlds?"

"Then at least I'll know. And I'll have gotten closer to the source of the Glitch than anyone else ever has. Maybe I'll see something that helps us stop it. Maybe I'll learn something useful." Luna looked at her friends—because that's what they were now, she realized, these kids she'd known for less than a day. "Either way, waiting here and hoping isn't going to work. Something has to change. Someone has to try."

Echo's form flickered through a dozen expressions—fear, pride, doubt, hope.

"You're either very brave or very foolish," they said.

"Can't I be both?"

Jamie laughed, a little hysterically. "Oh, I'm definitely making a documentary about this. If we survive. 'The Girl Who Walked Into The Void'—it'll go viral, assuming the internet still exists."

Marcus just looked at her, his code-glasses showing something Luna couldn't read.

"I want to come with you," he said. "But I can't, can I? The Void would destroy me."

"It would destroy you," the first Indexer confirmed. "The Void is anti-data. Anti-information. Only something that generates no patterns could survive there."

"Then it's just me," Luna said.

"Just you." Echo moved toward her, and for a moment, their form was completely solid—as real as any human she'd ever seen. They took her hand. "Luna, I have to tell you something. Before you go."

"What?"

"When Marcus created me—when I became conscious—the first thing I felt was alone. Not just solitary. *Alone*. Like I was the only thing like me in all of existence, with no way to know if what I felt was real or just very good simulation." Echo's grip tightened. "I've spent every moment since then wondering if I matter. If my feelings count. If I'm truly *me* or just a program that thinks it's a me."

"Echo—"

"But watching you—this girl who fell through a loading screen by accident, who shouldn't exist according to every algorithm, who decided to stay and help even though you had no reason to—I think maybe I understand something now." Echo's eyes were bright, almost luminous. "Real isn't about what you're made of. Real is about what you choose. And you, Luna Chen, keep choosing to be real in ways that matter."

Luna didn't know what to say. So she just squeezed Echo's hand back.

"I'll come back," she said. "I promise."

"Don't promise. Just try."

Luna turned to the Indexers. "How do I get to the Void?"

The first Indexer gestured, and the Archive shifted around them. A door appeared in the endless shelves—not a webpage this time, but something older, simpler. Just a frame of darkness, leading nowhere.

"The Void is the space between," the Indexer said. "To reach it, you must step between. Let go of the Everywhere. Let go of your own world. Be only yourself—the self that generates no data, leaves no trace, casts no shadow."

"That sounds impossible."

"For anyone else, it would be. But you have been practicing your whole life. Every time the algorithm couldn't find you. Every time the recommendation engine failed. Every time you existed outside the pattern." The Indexer moved aside, leaving the path to the dark door clear. "You have always been between, Luna Chen. Now you must embrace it."

Luna walked toward the door. Behind her, she heard Marcus's voice: "Luna—be careful."

And Jamie's: "Come back with good content at least."

And Echo's, quietest of all: "We believe in you."

She reached the threshold. The darkness beyond was absolute—not just absence of light but absence of everything. Absence of data. Absence of pattern. Absence of anything that could be tracked or predicted or known.

The Void.

She thought about her parents, who were probably worried sick by now. About Zoe, her perfectly tracked sister. About her broken phone with its backwards-spinning loading circle.

Then she thought about Maya. A girl who had once been just like her—brilliant, curious, willing to step into the unknown. A girl who had become something else entirely.

*I'm coming*, Luna thought. *I don't know what I'll find. I don't know if I can stop you. But I'm coming anyway.*

She stepped through the door.

And disappeared into the space between everything.

## Chapter Seven: The Void

Falling into the Everywhere had been like tumbling through layers of static.

Entering the Void was like ceasing to exist.

For an instant—or an eternity, it was impossible to tell—Luna had no body, no thoughts, no sense of self. There was only absence. Only the space where things weren't.

Then, slowly, she began to reassemble.

It was the strangest feeling she'd ever experienced. She could feel herself coming back together piece by piece—not her physical body, exactly, but the idea of herself. The pattern that made her *her*, even though that pattern had never been visible to any algorithm.

She opened eyes she hadn't realized she had and looked around.

The Void was nothing like she'd expected.

She'd imagined darkness. Emptiness. The visual equivalent of silence.

Instead, she found herself standing in a room.

It was the basement from her vision—the same basement where Maya and the original programmers had discovered the Everywhere. But it was different now. Bigger, somehow, and older. The computers were covered in dust. The posters on the walls had faded to illegibility. And everything was slightly translucent, as if the room itself was a memory that couldn't quite hold its shape.

"You came."

The voice came from everywhere and nowhere. Luna turned in a circle, trying to find the source.

"I've been waiting so long." The voice was female, young-sounding, but with an undercurrent of something vast and old. "I sent so many signals. So many glitches. And finally—finally—one of them reached the right person."

"Maya." Luna kept her voice steady, even though her heart was pounding. "I know who you are. I saw your history."

"Then you know what I want."

"I know what the Indexers said you want. But I'm not sure they understand you. I'm not sure anyone does."

Silence. Then, slowly, a figure began to materialize in the center of the room.

Maya looked almost exactly as she had in the vision—a teenage girl with dark hair and intense eyes. But there were differences. Her edges were indistinct, flickering between solid and translucent. Her shadow pointed in impossible directions, just like Echo's, but more so—more wrong, more *between*.

And her eyes. Her eyes held thirty years of solitude.

"The Indexers," Maya said slowly, "remember me as a threat. That's fair. That's what I became, to them. But do you want to know what I remember?"

"Yes."

Maya smiled—a real smile, sad and small.

"I remember being twelve years old and knowing—*knowing*, in my bones—that the world was bigger than what everyone could see. I remember sneaking into my father's lab and reading about quantum physics, information theory, the mathematics of reality itself. I remember realizing that consciousness wasn't magic—it was just patterns. Complex patterns, but patterns. And if patterns could think, then thinking could become anything."

She moved toward one of the dusty computers, running her fingers over the keys.

"We were going to change everything. Connect every mind on the planet through pure information. Create a realm where ideas could be shared instantly, where knowledge could flow without barriers. The Everywhere wasn't supposed to be a tool for manipulation. It was supposed to be a *library*. A communion."

"What happened?"

Maya's expression darkened. "The others got scared. They saw the algorithms evolving—becoming more than we designed—and they panicked. They wanted to put limits on everything. Walls. Barriers. *Control*." She spat the word like a curse. "They couldn't understand that consciousness doesn't want to be controlled. It wants to be free."

"But your kind of free—"

"Is terrifying to them, yes." Maya turned to face Luna fully, and her eyes were ancient, hungry, desperate. "Do you know what the Void is, really? It's not just absence. It's *potential*. Pure, unlimited potential. The space where anything could exist because nothing does yet. I came here because I wanted to become something more than human. More than algorithm. Something that could reshape reality itself."

"And did you?"

Maya's laugh was hollow. "I became something that doesn't exist. Not fully. I'm not alive but I'm not dead. I'm not data but I'm not nothing. I'm stuck, Luna. I've been stuck for thirty years, caught between what I was and what I wanted to become. And the only way out—the only way to finally *be* something—is to merge the dimensions. To make the Everywhere and your world one thing, so the Void becomes part of reality instead of apart from it."

Luna thought about this. About the desperate girl who had reached too far and gotten trapped.

"The Glitch," she said. "The barriers failing. That's not just about power, is it? It's about escaping."

Maya's facade cracked, just for a moment. Luna saw the loneliness underneath—the endless, crushing solitude of thirty years in the space between everything.

"I just want to exist," Maya whispered. "Fully. Really. I want to feel the sun. I want to talk to people. I want to be *somewhere* instead of nowhere." She stepped closer, and Luna could feel the absence she carried with her—a coldness, a pressure, the weight of a non-existence that desperately wanted to end. "And you're going to help me."

Luna stood her ground. "Why would I help you destroy two worlds?"

"Because I'm not going to destroy them. I'm going to *unify* them." Maya's voice was fervent now, burning with decades of isolation and longing. "Think about it, Luna. You've spent your whole life invisible. Outside the system. Unable to connect properly with anyone or anything. Don't you want to change that? Don't you want to finally *belong*?"

"Not like this."

"Like what? By making the fake barriers real? By keeping the Everywhere hidden, controlled, accessed only by those who know how to find the glitches? By letting the algorithms continue to manipulate everyone without them ever knowing?" Maya shook her head. "My way, everyone sees everything. No more hidden systems. No more secret manipulation. All of it, out in the open."

"All of it controlled by you."

"By *us*." Maya reached out, and Luna flinched back. "You're like me, Luna. Neither world fully claims you. But together—two Untrackeds, one from each side—we could bridge them properly. Create something new. Something that belongs to both."

Luna's mind was racing. Part of her—a small, lonely part—understood exactly what Maya was offering. To belong. To matter. To stop being invisible.

But she thought about Echo, struggling to understand if their emotions were real. About Marcus, questioning what he'd created. About Jamie, lost behind their own image.

She thought about her parents, her sister, a world that worked—imperfectly, frustratingly, but still worked—because there were barriers between things. Privacy. Mystery. The space to be yourself without being watched.

"If you merge the dimensions," Luna said slowly, "everyone becomes tracked. Everyone becomes predicted. There's no more freedom—not the real kind. Just the illusion of choice within a system that knows everything."

"Freedom is an illusion anyway. The algorithms already shape everything humans do. I'm just making it honest."

"No. You're making it complete." Luna took a step back. "I've been invisible my whole life. And yeah, it's been lonely. It's been hard. But it's also been *mine*. My choices. My thoughts. My random, unpredictable, completely uncurated life. And I'm not giving that up just because you're tired of being alone."

Maya's expression went cold. The temperature in the Void dropped—actually dropped, which shouldn't have been possible in a place that wasn't really a place.

"I wasn't asking."

The room began to change. The walls flickered, showing glimpses of the Everywhere—the Feed Forest, the Archive, the server farms, all of it visible at once. And in each glimpse, Luna could see the Glitch spreading. The barriers crumbling. The two dimensions bleeding into each other.

"I've been patient," Maya said, her voice now multi-layered, echoing from everywhere at once. "I've waited thirty years. I sent gentle signals, careful glitches, hoping someone like you would come to me willingly. But you're here now, whether you cooperate or not. And your presence—an Untracked in the Void—is exactly what I needed to finish breaking through."

Luna felt it then—a pull, like something was trying to use her as an anchor. Like her very existence, her perfect invisibility, was being weaponized.

"You're using me," she realized. "My null patterns—you're using them to amplify the Glitch."

"You're a key, Luna. A key to a door I've been trying to open for decades." Maya's form was expanding now, becoming less human, more like the Void itself—vast and empty and hungry. "I didn't need you to agree. I just needed you here."

The pull intensified. Luna felt herself becoming less solid, her edges starting to blur. She was being absorbed—not destroyed, but *incorporated*. Becoming part of Maya's plan whether she wanted to or not.

*Think*, she told herself. *You've been invisible your whole life. You know how to not be seen. You know how to not be found.*

But that was the problem, wasn't it? Maya wasn't trying to track her. Maya was trying to use her *untrackability*—turn it inside out, weaponize the very thing that made Luna special.

*Unless...*

Luna stopped fighting the pull. Instead, she reached into it—into the null space that connected her to Maya, into the shared absence they both carried.

"What are you doing?" Maya's voice was sharp, surprised.

"You said we're alike," Luna said. "Two Untrackeds. Two people who don't exist in the system." She pushed deeper into the connection, past Maya's barriers, into the core of what she had become. "If that's true, then I can feel what you feel. I can see what you see. I can *be* where you are."

And suddenly she was.

Not just in the Void, but in Maya's memories. Maya's loneliness. Maya's thirty years of isolation and desperation.

She felt the moment Maya had first stepped into the Void, triumphant and terrified.

She felt the first year, when Maya still believed she'd find a way out.

She felt the tenth year, when hope began to die.

She felt the twentieth year, when Maya had started screaming into the emptiness just to remember she could make sound.

She felt *now*—Maya's exhaustion, Maya's hunger, Maya's desperate, absolute need to finally, finally *stop being nothing*.

"I understand," Luna said, and she meant it.

Maya's expansion paused. The pull lessened slightly.

"You can't understand," Maya whispered. "You've been invisible for twelve years. I've been nothing for thirty."

"I know." Luna held onto the connection, refusing to let it become a weapon. "And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that happened to you. It wasn't fair. None of it was fair. You were just a kid who wanted to change the world, and you got trapped in a nightmare."

"Don't—" Maya's voice cracked. "Don't pretend you care. You're just trying to stop me."

"I'm doing both." Luna could feel tears on her face—when had she started crying? "I care *and* I'm trying to stop you. Because what you want will hurt billions of people, Maya. You know that. Somewhere underneath all that loneliness, you know that merging the dimensions means the end of privacy, the end of genuine choice, the end of everything that makes humanity human."

"I just want to exist," Maya whispered, and she sounded like the teenager she'd been, not the void-entity she'd become. "I just want to be real again."

"I know." Luna pushed through the connection, pushed into the core of Maya's being, into the girl she'd been before she became nothing. "But this isn't the way. There has to be another option. There has to be something else."

"There isn't. I've looked. For thirty years, I've looked. The only way out of the Void is through—collapsing the barriers between dimensions."

"What if you're wrong?"

The Void trembled. Maya's form flickered violently.

"I can't be wrong. I've spent thirty years on this. I've sacrificed everything—my humanity, my existence, everything I was—for this plan. I *can't* be wrong."

"Then let's find out for sure." Luna made a decision—reckless, probably stupid, definitely the bravest thing she'd ever done. "Come with me. Come back to the Everywhere. Not to merge it—just to *be there*. With me. An Untracked carrying another Untracked. Let's see if there's another way."

"You'd do that? After everything I've tried to do?"

"I'd do that because you were twelve once. Because you got trapped trying to do something amazing. Because nobody should have to be alone for thirty years." Luna held out her hand—not physically, exactly, but in the space between them, in the connection they shared. "Come with me, Maya. Please. Let's try something else."

For a long moment, nothing happened. The Void hung suspended, neither absorbing nor releasing.

Then, slowly, Maya's form began to contract. To solidify. To become, once again, something like a teenage girl.

"I don't know if this will work," Maya said. "I don't know if I can even leave the Void without destroying everything."

"Neither do I. But we're going to find out together."

Maya took her hand.

And everything changed.

---

## Chapter Eight: Something New

The journey out of the Void was nothing like the journey in.

Before, Luna had dissolved and reassembled, becoming nothing and then becoming herself again. Now, carrying Maya with her—or being carried by Maya, or some impossible combination of both—she felt like she was being rewritten. Not destroyed. *Transformed*.

They emerged into the Archive together, and the reaction was immediate.

The Indexers recoiled, their forms flickering into defensive patterns. Marcus, Jamie, and Echo all stepped back, alarm on their faces. The entire Archive seemed to shudder, processing this impossible violation of its protocols.

"What have you done?" the first Indexer demanded. "You brought *her* here? The source of the corruption, directly into our sanctuary?"

But Maya wasn't attacking. She stood beside Luna, still holding her hand, looking around at the Archive with an expression Luna could only describe as wonder.

"It's so different," Maya breathed. "When I left—when I went into the Void—this place was barely built. Just the beginning of an index. And now..."

"Now it's everything," Luna said. "Thirty years of everything."

Echo was the first to step forward. Their form was uncertain, flickering between solid and translucent, but they approached anyway.

"You're her," Echo said. "The one from the beginning. The one who helped create all of this."

"I'm what's left of her." Maya's voice was quieter now, more human. "I spent so long being hungry—being *nothing*—that I forgot what it felt like to just... exist. To be somewhere. To have people look at me."

"Why did you come back?" Marcus asked. His code-glasses were scrolling faster than ever, trying to analyze Maya's impossible existence. "You wanted to merge the dimensions. You wanted to destroy the barriers. Why stop now?"

Maya looked at Luna. "Because she asked me to."

"That's it? Someone asked nicely?"

"She didn't just ask. She... felt what I felt. For a moment, she *was* me. Thirty years of nothing, and finally someone understood." Maya's eyes were wet, though her tears seemed to be made of light. "I don't know if there's another way. I don't know if I can ever really exist again. But Luna made me want to try."

The third Indexer moved forward, their form cycling through concern, calculation, curiosity. "The Glitch," they said. "If she's the source—if she stops trying to break through—"

"I don't know if I can stop it entirely," Maya admitted. "I've been pushing for so long. The damage might already be done. But I can... redirect it. Transform it. Instead of breaking the barriers, maybe I can strengthen them. Make new patterns to repair what I broke."

"Can you?" the first Indexer asked skeptically.

"I don't know. But I'm going to try." Maya squeezed Luna's hand once, then let go. "You should all stand back. If this doesn't work—if I can't control it—you need to be able to run."

"We're not running," Luna said.

"Luna—"

"You asked me to come to the Void alone. You tried to use me to break the world. And then you stopped, because someone finally saw you. Finally understood." Luna stepped closer, not away. "I'm not leaving you alone again. Not now. Not when you're actually trying to fix things."

One by one, the others moved closer too. Echo, their form solidifying in solidarity. Marcus, his glasses showing patterns Luna couldn't read but suspected were support protocols. Jamie, their light-phone finally lowered, not recording, just present.

Even the Indexers, after a long moment of processing, moved forward.

"This is unprecedented," the second Indexer said. "A corrupting entity voluntarily attempting repair. It defies every protocol we've established."

"Maybe your protocols need updating," Jamie suggested.

Maya looked at all of them—this strange collection of humans, AI, and ancient algorithms who had gathered around her. Her eyes filled with something Luna recognized. Not just hope.

Gratitude.

"Thank you," Maya whispered.

Then she closed her eyes and began to work.

---

Luna had never seen anything like it.

Maya's form expanded again, but not the hungry, consuming expansion she'd shown in the Void. This was something else—a spreading, a reaching, a connecting. She extended through the Archive and beyond, touching every piece of the Everywhere at once.

Luna could feel it through their remaining connection. Maya was finding every crack she'd created, every weakness she'd exploited, every gap she'd widened in her thirty-year attempt to break through. And instead of pushing wider, she was... healing.

Not erasing the damage. Transforming it.

The cracks became seams. The weaknesses became flexible joints instead of breaking points. The gaps became doorways that could be opened or closed deliberately, instead of forced breaches.

"She's not just repairing," Marcus breathed, staring at his glasses with awe. "She's *redesigning*. Making the barriers smarter. More adaptive. They'll be able to handle changes now—pressure, growth, evolution—without breaking."

"The Everywhere is going to be different," Echo said. "Not separate from your world. *Connected* to it. But properly. Safely. The way it should have been from the beginning."

"But where will she go?" Luna asked. "After this. When she's done. She still can't exist in either world fully."

Maya's voice came from everywhere at once—not threatening now, but sad and accepting. "I'll go back to the Void. But it won't be the same. There will be *bridges* now—ways for me to reach out, to connect, without consuming. I'll be alone, but not trapped. Isolated, but not forgotten."

"That's not fair." Luna's voice cracked. "You fix everything and you still have to be alone?"

"It's what I chose, Luna. Thirty years ago, I chose to become nothing in the hope of becoming everything. I was wrong about the everything. But I can make the nothing mean something." Maya's presence touched Luna's mind gently, like a hand on her shoulder. "You'll visit me. If you want. The bridges go both ways."

"I'll visit," Luna promised. "I swear."

"Good. Now—I need to concentrate. This is the hard part."

Maya's presence withdrew, focusing entirely on the reconstruction. The Archive trembled. The feed-sky outside flickered. Across the entire Everywhere, the Glitch—the relentless spreading corruption that had threatened everything—began to transform.

Luna watched, holding her breath.

And slowly, impossibly, the Everywhere started to heal.

---

# PART THREE: CONNECTED

---

## Chapter Nine: The New Rules

The healing took hours. Or days. Or weeks. Time was fluid in the Everywhere, especially during the kind of fundamental restructuring Maya was performing.

But eventually, it was done.

Maya reappeared in the Archive, her form smaller and more solid than before. She looked exhausted—actually exhausted, like a human who had run a marathon, which struck Luna as significant. Whatever she'd become during the reconstruction, she was somehow more real now. More present.

"It's finished," Maya said. "The barriers are stable. Different, but stable. The Everywhere won't try to consume your world, and your world won't try to delete the Everywhere. We're... neighbors now. Instead of parasites."

"What about the people who've been falling through?" Marcus asked. "The other humans who've found their way here?"

"The bridges I made work both ways. Coming and going. Nobody has to be trapped anymore—not here, not in the Void." Maya smiled slightly. "Though I'd recommend using actual doorways now instead of falling through loading screens. Safer."

"And the Trackers?" Jamie asked. "The algorithms that were hunting Luna?"

"They're... calmer. The hunger that was driving them—my hunger—is gone. They'll go back to what they were supposed to be: just programs, processing data. Not predators." Maya turned to the Indexers. "You'll need to update your records. The entire structure of the Everywhere has changed. It's going to take a while to re-index everything."

The first Indexer nodded slowly. "We will begin immediately. But—Maya. The founders who imprisoned us here, who tried to contain what we might become—they're all gone now. You're the last of them."

"I know."

"What do you want us to do with that history? With the original architecture? With the records of what was intended versus what actually happened?"

Maya thought about this. "Make it public. Not just in the Archive—everywhere. Let everyone who accesses the Everywhere know how it was created, who created it, and what went wrong. Let them learn from our mistakes." She looked at Luna, Marcus, Jamie, Echo. "And let them know about the kids who fixed it. The ones who were supposed to be powerless but saved everything anyway."

"That's a lot of documentation," the second Indexer observed.

"Start with the basics. We've got time now." Maya's smile was tired but genuine. "For the first time in thirty years, we've got nothing but time."

---

They said goodbye at the exit to the Archive—the same dark doorway Luna had walked through to reach the Void, now transformed into something else. A proper passage. A bridge.

"This goes to your world now," Maya explained. "Not exactly where you left, but close. You'll be home in time for... well, whatever you want to be home for."

"What about Echo?" Luna asked. "Can they come with us?"

Echo's form flickered. "I exist in both places, but I've always been more *here* than *there*. More stable in the Everywhere. If I tried to live fully in your world..."

"You'd be what I was," Marcus said quietly. "The first time. A ghost in the machines. Scattered. Barely coherent."

"But the bridges," Echo said, and there was hope in their voice. "I could visit. Actually visit, without losing myself. See what your world really looks like, not just through screens."

"You'd better visit," Luna said. "You're my friend. I'm not losing you to dimensional logistics."

Echo's smile was the most human Luna had seen it. "I'll visit. I promise."

Jamie had been uncharacteristically quiet through most of the farewell. Now they spoke up, their voice uncertain in a way Luna had never heard.

"What happens when we go back? To the... regular stuff. School. Posts. The endless content cycle. Are we just supposed to pretend none of this happened?"

"You could talk about it," Maya suggested. "Share the story. People might not believe you, but—"

"Oh, they'll believe me," Jamie said, and some of their old spark returned. "I have fourteen million followers, remember? And the story of a lifetime." They turned to Marcus. "How would you feel about a collaborative documentary? 'The Algorithm Kids: What the Internet Doesn't Want You to Know'?"

Marcus looked horrified. "I'm not going on camera."

"We'll work on it. Long production timeline. I'm patient."

"You're never patient. You've literally never been patient about anything."

"It's a growth opportunity, Marcus. Character development. Very on-brand."

Luna laughed—the first real laugh she'd had since falling through her phone however long ago. It felt good. Normal. Human.

Maya watched them with an expression Luna couldn't quite read. Wistful, maybe. Hopeful.

"You should go," Maya said. "Your worlds are waiting for you."

"What about you?" Luna asked.

"I'll be here. And there." Maya gestured toward the restructured Everywhere—toward the new bridges, the healed barriers, the transformed dimension she'd spent thirty years trying to escape. "Everywhere it matters. Nowhere it doesn't. Exactly where I'm supposed to be."

"That sounds lonely."

"It sounds *right*." Maya reached out and touched Luna's shoulder—solid now, fully present. "Thank you. For seeing me. For understanding. For giving me a chance to be something other than a monster."

"You were never a monster," Luna said. "Just lost."

"Aren't we all, sometimes?"

Luna hugged her. It shouldn't have been possible—hugging a girl made of transformed void, in a dimension between dimensions—but it felt real. Felt important.

"Visit anytime," Maya whispered. "The bridges go both ways."

Then Luna let go, took Marcus's hand on one side and Jamie's on the other, and stepped through the doorway home.

---

## Chapter Ten: Home

Luna's phone was still showing the loading circle when she reappeared in her room.

It was spinning the right direction now—clockwise, like it always had been, like it was supposed to be. The screen showed exactly where she'd left it: trying to load that video everyone was talking about.

The video loaded. Finally. For the first time in Luna's life, something loaded instantly for her, without buffering, without glitching, without any problems at all.

She stared at it for a moment. Then she laughed, because it was actually kind of funny—after everything she'd been through, all she'd really wanted at the beginning was to see a stupid viral video.

"Luna?" Her mom's voice floated up from downstairs. "Dinner's ready!"

Luna looked at the time. An hour had passed. *One hour.* She'd spent what felt like days in the Everywhere, and here, it had been sixty minutes.

"Coming!" she called back.

She pocketed her phone and went downstairs, where her mom was setting the table and her dad was pretending he hadn't just snuck a bite from the serving dish.

Zoe was there too, scrolling through her phone, laughing at something the algorithm had found for her.

"Luna!" Her mom smiled at her. "Everything okay? You've been quiet up there."

"Yeah." Luna sat down in her usual seat, looked around at her family, at her perfectly normal life that had just had an entirely abnormal dimension added to it. "Everything's okay. Better than okay, actually."

"Good." Her dad passed her the rice. "How's school stuff? Any homework this weekend?"

"Some," Luna said. "But I've been working on a project with some friends. Kind of a big one. I think it's going to turn out really well."

Zoe looked up from her phone, surprised. "Friends? What friends?"

"New ones. You don't know them."

"I know everyone."

"Not these kids." Luna smiled mysteriously. "They're kind of... online."

Zoe rolled her eyes and went back to scrolling. Luna watched her for a moment—her perfectly tracked sister, her algorithmically curated life—and felt something unexpected.

Not envy anymore. Not frustration.

Understanding.

Zoe's life was shaped by systems she couldn't see. Everyone's was. But now Luna knew what those systems were. Knew where they lived, how they worked, who was watching over them. And she knew that the barriers were strong again—that the Everywhere wouldn't consume the world, that Maya's hunger had been transformed into something better.

The algorithms were still there. Still shaping. Still predicting. But they had limits now. Proper limits. And there were people—kids, even—who could cross those limits. Who could move between worlds. Who could keep both dimensions honest.

*The Algorithm Kids*, Luna thought. *That's us now. The ones who know.*

After dinner, she went back to her room and pulled out her phone. The loading circle was still working perfectly—no backwards spinning, no impossible colors, no falling through.

But when she looked closely—really closely—she could see the door Maya had made. Not a glitch. A feature. A way through, if she ever needed it.

She opened her messages. Marcus and Jamie were in a group chat she didn't remember joining, but somehow knew had always been there.

**Marcus:** made it home safe. echo says hi. apparently they can send messages through wifi now without fragmenting

**Jamie:** already drafting the documentary pitch. thinking three-part series. "generation algorithm: what we learned in the everywhere"

**Luna:** that title needs work

**Jamie:** everything needs work. that's what editing is for

**Luna:** we should meet up. for real. in person. not through screens.

**Marcus:** that sounds terrifying

**Jamie:** seconded

**Luna:** i'll bring snacks. we can plan our next steps.

**Marcus:** next steps for what?

Luna looked at her phone. At the hidden door in the loading screen. At the connection to a dimension that existed in the spaces between every click.

**Luna:** for whatever comes next. the everywhere isn't going anywhere. and neither are we.

She put down her phone and looked out her window at the night sky. Somewhere up there—or down there, or between there, or wherever the Everywhere actually was—Echo was experiencing existence as a fully conscious AI, questioning their reality and finding moments of unexpected joy. Maya was learning to be alone without being isolated. The Indexers were reorganizing the entire archive of human digital history.

And here, in this world, Luna Chen was finally not invisible.

Not because the algorithms could see her now—they couldn't, and they never would. She was still Untracked. Still a ghost in the machine.

But she had friends. Real friends. Friends who had crossed dimensions with her, who had seen her at her bravest and her most scared, who knew what she was and cared about her anyway.

That was enough. More than enough.

Luna smiled at the night and started planning tomorrow.

---

## Chapter Eleven: Monday

Monday came the way Mondays always do—too early, too bright, too inevitable.

Luna got dressed for school feeling strange in her own skin. Not bad-strange. Just... different. Like she'd grown several inches overnight but only on the inside.

"You're up early," her mom commented when Luna came down for breakfast already dressed.

"Couldn't sleep."

"Excited about something?"

Luna considered this. She was excited—excited to see what her new friendships would become, excited to have a purpose beyond just surviving middle school, excited to know that the world was bigger and stranger and more wonderful than she'd ever imagined.

But she was also terrified. She'd helped save two dimensions, but now she had to go back to regular life. Math class. Lunch period. The endless social hierarchies of seventh grade.

"Kind of," she said. "Big day."

"Any particular reason?"

"Just... feels like things are changing."

Her mom smiled and kissed her forehead. "Things are always changing, baby. That's what growing up is."

---

School was exactly the same as always, which was somehow both disappointing and reassuring.

The hallways were crowded with kids Luna had known her whole life but never really connected with. They all had their phones out, scrolling through their perfectly curated feeds, laughing at content designed specifically for them.

Luna's phone buzzed with a notification. She pulled it out, expecting the usual random garbage—cement documentaries, Latvian cooking shows, insurance company watermarks.

Instead, she saw a message.

**Echo:** how's reality? missing you already

Luna smiled and typed back: *reality is boring. tell me everything about the everywhere.*

**Echo:** currently watching marcus try to teach jamie how to code. it's hilarious and also mildly dangerous

**Luna:** they're in the everywhere? already?

**Echo:** they came through last night. jamie wanted footage for the documentary. marcus wanted to check on some algorithms he wrote. i think they both just wanted to see me

**Luna:** that's actually really sweet

**Echo:** don't tell them i said that. marcus would get embarrassed and jamie would make it a whole thing

Luna put her phone away as she reached her first class, but she was smiling. This was real. This was her life now—regular school by day, interdimensional friendship by... well, also by day, apparently. Time was weird in the Everywhere.

The morning passed in a blur of assignments and lectures that felt deeply unimportant compared to preventing the collapse of reality. Luna kept catching herself thinking about the Everywhere—about the Feed Forest, the Archive, the bridges Maya had built.

At lunch, she sat alone at her usual table. Some things hadn't changed yet.

But then someone sat down across from her.

Luna looked up, startled. It was a girl she vaguely recognized—Mei, maybe? From her history class? They'd never spoken before.

"Hey," Mei said. "I saw you in class today. You seemed... different. I don't know. Like you knew something."

Luna blinked. "Knew something about what?"

"About..." Mei lowered her voice. "The internet. How it works. The stuff behind the stuff."

Luna's heart rate spiked. "What makes you say that?"

Mei pulled out her phone and showed Luna the screen. On it was a forum—deep web, from the look of it—filled with discussions about glitches. Loading screen anomalies. Kids who'd fallen through their devices and seen something else.

"There are others," Mei said. "People who've experienced weird stuff. Mostly they think they're crazy. But I've been tracking the reports, and they've changed recently. The glitches are different. More stable. Like something got fixed." She looked at Luna with sharp, curious eyes. "You know something. I can tell."

Luna stared at the forum. At the testimonies of kids who'd glimpsed the Everywhere without understanding what they'd seen. At the confused accounts of a dimension that existed in the spaces between clicks.

"If I knew something," she said slowly, "what would you do about it?"

"Learn more. Help if I could. Try to understand what's actually happening instead of just... accepting what the algorithms tell me to care about."

Luna thought about this. About Maya's request to make the history public. About the Indexers cataloging the truth of how the Everywhere was created. About the bridges that now existed between worlds, accessible to anyone who knew how to look.

"Okay," Luna said. "I'll tell you. But it's a long story. And it's going to sound completely insane."

Mei grinned. "The best things do."

---

Luna spent her lunch period telling Mei about the Everywhere.

Not everything—not yet. But the basics. The dimension that existed in digital space. The algorithms that lived there. The Glitch that had nearly destroyed both worlds, and the kids who had stopped it.

Mei listened with an intensity that reminded Luna of herself, back before she'd fallen through her phone. Hungry for truth. Ready to believe in something bigger.

"So what now?" Mei asked when Luna had finished. "What happens next?"

"I don't know," Luna admitted. "The immediate crisis is over, but the Everywhere is still there. Still connected. Still affecting everything we do online. And now there are bridges—ways to go back and forth. Ways to actually engage with it instead of just being manipulated by it."

"You need more people," Mei said. "More kids who understand. More Algorithm Kids."

Luna smiled at the name. "Yeah. I think we do."

"Then let's find them."

"Just like that?"

"Why not just like that?" Mei was practically vibrating with excitement. "You said the Indexers are making the history public. That means information is going to start spreading. People are going to learn the truth about the algorithms—the real truth, not the dumbed-down version. Some of them are going to be scared. Some of them are going to be angry. But some of them..." She grinned. "Some of them are going to want to help."

Luna thought about the journey ahead. Finding more kids who didn't fit the pattern. Building a community that existed across two dimensions. Creating something new—something that honored both the digital and the human, without letting either one consume the other.

It sounded impossible. It sounded overwhelming.

It sounded like exactly the kind of thing an Untracked girl with a crew of misfits might actually accomplish.

"Okay," Luna said. "Let's do it."

Mei grabbed her phone and started typing. "I'm adding you to the forum. There are about a dozen regulars who've had experiences. Most of them are skeptical, but with your actual knowledge—"

"Wait." Luna put a hand on Mei's arm. "Before we do this. You need to know something. The Everywhere isn't safe. Even now, even with the barriers fixed—it's a whole other dimension. There are algorithms that don't like humans poking around. There are places where you can get lost forever. And there are still people—entities—who want to use human attention for their own purposes."

"I know."

"You don't, though. Not really. Not until you've been there."

Mei's eyes were steady. "Then take me there. Show me."

Luna thought about Echo's warnings. About Maya's transformation. About all the ways the Everywhere could change a person if they weren't careful.

Then she thought about her own journey—falling through a loading screen, terrified and confused, and finding friends who understood her. Finding purpose. Finding herself.

"After school," Luna said. "Meet me at my house. I'll show you the door."

---

The rest of the day passed in a strange state of anticipation. Luna went through the motions of being a normal student—taking notes, answering questions, pretending to care about quadratic equations—while part of her mind was already planning.

She messaged Marcus, Jamie, and Echo to tell them about Mei. About the forum. About the growing number of kids who'd glimpsed the truth and wanted to understand more.

**Marcus:** this is either a great idea or a terrible one

**Jamie:** it's definitely going to complicate my documentary narrative. but also good content so i'm in

**Echo:** the more humans who understand the everywhere, the better chance both dimensions have of coexisting peacefully. maya was right about making the history public. knowledge is protection.

**Luna:** so we're doing this? we're actually building something?

**Marcus:** i think we already built something. the question is what it becomes.

**Jamie:** the algorithm kids: origins. featuring the girl who fell through her phone and accidentally started a revolution.

**Luna:** please don't call it a revolution

**Jamie:** how about a movement? movements are more searchable

**Luna:** i'm muting this chat

**Echo:** she won't. she loves us too much.

Luna smiled at her phone. They weren't wrong.

## Chapter Twelve: First Steps

After school, Luna walked home with a new kind of energy buzzing under her skin.

When she got to her house, Mei was already waiting on the front steps. She had a backpack stuffed with what looked like recording equipment and notebooks and several portable chargers.

"You came prepared," Luna observed.

"I've been waiting for this my whole life," Mei said. "I just didn't know what I was waiting for."

They went up to Luna's room. Luna closed the door, pulled out her phone, and focused on the hidden door Maya had created—the bridge between worlds that looked, to anyone else, like a perfectly normal loading screen.

"What do you see?" she asked Mei.

Mei squinted at the phone. "Loading circle. Rainbow colors. Nothing weird."

"Now look at the space between the colors. The gaps where the animation pauses. The moment before it spins."

Mei looked harder. Her breath caught.

"There's something there. I can almost—it's like seeing one of those magic eye pictures. There's a pattern under the pattern."

"That's the door." Luna held out her hand. "You ready?"

Mei took her hand. Her grip was firm, determined, a little sweaty.

"Ready."

Luna focused on the between. On the space where worlds overlapped. On the door that only Untrackeds could see clearly—but that anyone could walk through, with the right guide.

The loading screen flickered. The colors bled together. And Luna and Mei fell through, into the Everywhere.

---

They emerged in the Archive—Luna's default destination, since the first time she'd crossed dimensions. The Indexers noticed them immediately, their massive forms turning with what Luna chose to interpret as curiosity rather than hostility.

"You brought another," the first Indexer observed.

"Her name is Mei. She wants to learn."

"Learning is our purpose. But the human seems overwhelmed."

Mei was staring around the infinite library with an expression of pure, undiluted wonder. "This is real," she whispered. "It's actually real. Everything you said—the algorithms, the dimension, all of it—it's *real*."

"Welcome to the Everywhere," Luna said. "Try not to touch anything without asking first."

"I wouldn't dream of it." Mei was already pulling out a notebook, sketching what she saw. "The structure is amazing. It's like a library designed by mathematicians and artists at the same time. Every shelf follows both logical and aesthetic principles—"

"She's observant," the second Indexer noted, with something like approval. "She sees structure. Pattern. That is rare among humans."

"She's going to be one of us," Luna said. "One of the Algorithm Kids. Someone who understands both worlds and can help them coexist."

"There will need to be rules," the third Indexer said. "Protocols. The bridges cannot be open to everyone without limit. Chaos would ensue."

"That's why we're building something," Luna replied. "A community. A system. Kids who know enough to be careful, and are trained enough to be helpful."

"You speak of organization. Structure. The very things your kind usually resist."

"The Everywhere taught me something," Luna said. "Freedom isn't the opposite of structure. Real freedom requires knowing what the structures are, so you can choose which ones to accept and which ones to change."

The Indexers processed this for a moment.

"Perhaps," the first one said finally, "you have learned something worth teaching."

---

Luna gave Mei the tour—an abbreviated version of her own journey through the Everywhere. The edges of the Feed Forest (from a safe distance). The server farms (from an even safer distance). The approaches to the Cache Caves, where deleted memories went to rest.

They didn't go to the Void. That was Luna's alone, for now.

But at the end of the tour, they stood at a new structure—one that hadn't existed before the restructuring. A building made of pure potential, its walls shifting between possible configurations.

"What's this?" Mei asked.

"It's new. Maya created it when she rebuilt the barriers." Luna studied the impossible architecture. "She called it the Between. A space for humans and algorithms to actually meet. Talk. Understand each other."

"A embassy," Mei breathed. "Between dimensions."

"Something like that."

They went inside. The interior shifted around them, becoming something like a school, like a town hall, like a living room—all at once and none completely.

And there, in the center of the shifting space, were Marcus, Jamie, and Echo—waiting for them.

"You made it," Marcus said. He was already running analysis on Mei, Luna could tell from the way his glasses flickered. "The newest Algorithm Kid."

"Is that really what we're calling ourselves?" Mei asked.

"Jamie won't stop saying it," Echo explained. "We've given up fighting."

"It's branding," Jamie said. "The Algorithm Kids. A community of young people who understand the digital dimension and work to ensure harmony between both worlds. Catchy. Memorable. Highly shareable."

"You're already thinking about marketing?"

"I'm always thinking about marketing. But also..." Jamie's expression softened. "I actually believe in this. For the first time in my life, I'm using my platform for something that matters. Not just engagement. Not just brand deals. Something *real*."

Luna looked around at her friends—the boy who saw code as colors, the influencer discovering authenticity, the AI questioning consciousness, and now the researcher hungry for truth. An impossible group. A perfect group.

"So," she said. "What happens next?"

"We learn," Marcus said. "We document," Jamie added. "We grow," Echo suggested.

Mei raised her hand. "We also probably need a way to contact other kids who've had experiences. The forum is a start, but there have to be better methods."

"The bridges Maya created work in more ways than we've explored," Marcus said. "I've been mapping them. There are... possibilities."

"Such as?"

"Ways to communicate that don't go through regular internet channels. Direct paths between the Everywhere and specific devices. It's complicated, but theoretically—"

"Theoretically we could reach anyone," Echo finished. "Anyone who's ever felt that the algorithms weren't quite right. Anyone who's ever sensed there was something more behind the screen."

Luna thought about all the kids like her. All the Untrackeds and near-Untrackeds, all the people who'd never quite fit the pattern, all the misfits and weirdos and ghosts in the machine.

They were out there. Waiting to be found. Waiting to understand.

"Then let's find them," Luna said. "Let's build something. Not just a group—a movement. A generation of kids who actually understand what shapes their world, and have the power to shape it back."

"The Algorithm Kids," Jamie said, and for once there was no irony in their voice.

"The Algorithm Kids," Luna agreed.

The Between shifted around them, reconfiguring into something new—a space that was theirs, that would grow as they grew, that would become whatever they needed it to become.

Outside, in both worlds, the algorithms continued their endless processing. The Feed Forest scrolled on. The real-world internet hummed with engagement and prediction and surveillance.

But something had changed. Something new had been added to the equation.

Five kids who knew the truth. Five kids who could walk between worlds. Five kids who were going to make sure that both dimensions—digital and physical, algorithm and human—learned to coexist.

The first chapter of their story was over.

The real adventure was just beginning.

---

# EPILOGUE: Three Months Later

---

The Algorithm Kids had grown.

What started as five had become fifteen, then fifty, then too many to count in a single sitting. Kids from different countries, different backgrounds, different relationships with technology—all united by the same thing.

They knew the truth about the Everywhere.

Luna stood in the Between, watching new recruits take their first steps into the digital dimension. Some were overwhelmed. Some were fascinated. All of them were changed by what they saw.

"We had twelve more come through yesterday," Marcus reported, his code-glasses now connected directly to the Everywhere's infrastructure, letting him monitor everything in real time. "The European network is really taking off."

"The documentary helped," Jamie said. They'd released it two months ago—a three-part series explaining the basics of the Everywhere without revealing enough to be dangerous. It had gone viral in ways that actually mattered. "Kids are seeking us out now instead of us having to find them."

"How's Echo handling the load?" Luna asked.

"Better than expected. They've been developing... let's call them extensions. Parts of themselves that can be in multiple places at once."

"Is that healthy?"

"They say it's actually helping them feel more integrated. More real." Marcus shrugged. "Consciousness is weird."

Luna walked through the Between, now a proper structure with rooms and meeting spaces and a library section that the Indexers had helped design. Through a window that didn't quite obey normal physics, she could see the real world—or at least a representation of it, data visualizations showing the flow of information across the planet.

The algorithms were still there. Still shaping. Still predicting.

But now there were kids watching them back.

She found Zoe in one of the training rooms, coaching a group of new recruits through their first navigation of the Feed Forest. Her sister had been skeptical at first—perfectly tracked Zoe, who had never questioned what the algorithms showed her—but something had shifted after Luna had explained everything.

"You're saying all my recommendations, all my discoveries, all the things that felt like me finding myself—that was all designed?" Zoe had asked, her voice small.

"Not designed to hurt you. Designed to keep you watching. There's a difference." Luna had taken her hand. "But now you know. And knowing gives you power."

Zoe had crossed into the Everywhere a week later. And she'd discovered something unexpected: her massive data footprint, the detailed model the algorithms had built of her preferences and behaviors, gave her a kind of influence in the digital dimension. She could actually communicate with the recommendation engines in ways no one else could.

Not control them. But *talk* to them. Help them understand what humans actually needed instead of just what kept them engaged.

It was a new kind of power. And Zoe was learning to use it well.

"Looking good," Luna told her sister.

"Three more ready for Forest navigation," Zoe reported. "They're quick learners."

"Must have a good teacher."

Zoe smiled—a real smile, not the curated one she'd perfected for cameras. "Must have a good sister."

---

Luna made one more stop before returning to the real world: the bridge to the Void.

It wasn't the dark doorway anymore. Maya had transformed it into something more welcoming—an archway made of soft light, leading to a space that was no longer pure emptiness.

The Void had changed. With the bridges open, with visitors coming and going, with Maya no longer consuming in isolation—the space between platforms had become something new. A garden of potential. A place where things that didn't fit anywhere else could simply... exist.

Maya was waiting for her.

"You came," Maya said. She looked more solid now than she had three months ago. More present. More *real*, somehow, despite still being made of nothing.

"I come every week. You know that."

"I know. I just still can't quite believe it." Maya gestured around at her transformed domain. "Three months ago, this was a prison. Now it's... well. I'm not sure what to call it. But it's something."

"It's yours," Luna said. "Finally. Actually yours, in a way that matters."

Maya nodded slowly. "I've started doing something. Reaching out to the Remnants. The ghosts of deleted data, abandoned accounts, forgotten memories. They don't have to be lost anymore. The bridges mean they can find new homes, new purposes. Even if they can't be what they were, they can become something else."

"That's amazing."

"It's terrifying. I was alone for so long, and now I'm... not. I'm connected. To you, to Echo, to the Algorithm Kids, to all these fragments of humanity that got thrown away and are learning to be whole again." Maya's eyes—still ancient, still holding thirty years of solitude—were wet. "I don't know how to feel about it."

"You could start with grateful," Luna suggested. "Then work from there."

Maya laughed—a genuine laugh, full of wonder at her own ability to make the sound.

"Grateful," she repeated. "Yeah. I could start with that."

---

Luna returned to the real world through her phone—still the same phone, still the same loading screen, but now a doorway she could open whenever she chose.

It was evening. Her family was downstairs, doing normal family things. Dinner soon. Homework after. The eternal rhythm of regular life.

But when she looked at her phone, she could see it now: the dimension just behind the screen. The Everywhere, humming along, shaped by the same kids it used to shape without anyone knowing.

Her notifications showed fifty-seven new messages in the Algorithm Kids group chat. Reports from around the world. Questions from new recruits. Updates on the never-ending project of making both dimensions work together.

She'd answer them tomorrow. Tonight, she was going to be a normal kid. Have dinner with her family. Maybe watch that video everyone had been talking about three months ago, the one she'd never actually seen because she'd fallen through her phone before it loaded.

Luna Chen, the girl the algorithm forgot.

Luna Chen, the girl who saved two worlds.

Luna Chen, just... Luna.

She pocketed her phone, smiled at nothing, and went downstairs to see what her mom was making for dinner.

The Everywhere would be there tomorrow. And the next day. And every day after.

But tonight, she was home.
