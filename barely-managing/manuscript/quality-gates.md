# Quality Gates

Every chapter must pass all five gates before revision lock.

## 1) Narrative Test
- includes at least one scene-level anecdote
- stakes, conflict, and aftermath are explicit

## 2) Practicality Test
- includes one concrete managerial decision
- ends with a reusable checklist or tool

## 3) Differentiation Test
- content is specific and operational, not abstract leadership advice
- Four Bases logic appears where relevant and is explicit in chapters 9-13

## 4) Safety Test
- no direct identifiers in sensitive stories
- anonymization notes completed for high-risk anecdotes

## 5) Coherence Test
- chapter supports the throughline from high-support to low-safety-net management
- transition sentence aligns with adjacent chapters

## Review Scenarios

1. First-time manager applies Chapter 10 to a mock performance case.
2. Chapter 11 no-promotion draft is tested for empathy and clarity.
3. Chapter 13 draft is checked for legal/ethical overclaiming.
4. Query package is reviewed as a complete submission set.
5. Full manuscript is checked against the 60,000-75,000 word target.
