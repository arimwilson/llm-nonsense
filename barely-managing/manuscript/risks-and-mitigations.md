# Risks and Mitigations

## Risk: anecdote repetitiveness
Mitigation: run uniqueness check in `research/anecdote-cards.md` before drafting each chapter.

## Risk: tone drifts to generic leadership advice
Mitigation: require one concrete "what happened" section before principle/tool sections.

## Risk: schedule slip
Mitigation: keep Friday review lock and enforce one-chapter rollover maximum.

## Risk: sensitivity/legal exposure
Mitigation: apply moderate anonymization rules and add HR/legal wording review for chapters 10-13.
