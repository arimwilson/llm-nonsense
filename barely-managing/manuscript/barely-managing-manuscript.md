# Introduction

Every manager eventually feels like they are barely managing. This manuscript is built on the claim that this feeling is not a defect. It is a signal that the job is real, people are affected by your choices, and leadership requires frameworks strong enough to hold pressure without erasing humanity.

The chapters combine management stories from Google and Celonis with practical tools for hard conversations, performance decisions, and scaling leadership systems.

# Chapter 10: Performance Problems and the Four Bases

I had the conversation backward.

I knew it while I was saying the words, but I kept talking anyway.

It was a Tuesday in late quarter. We were behind on two delivery commitments, and one engineer on my team had missed three critical handoffs in six weeks. I had notes. I had dates. I had escalation language from HR. I had a clean narrative for why we needed to act.

What I did not have was a complete case.

I had Business and Legal/Ethical in hand. I could explain deadlines, dependencies, and documented expectations. I could defend the process. I could prove we were not improvising.

I did not have Team and Role in a way the engineer could actually hear.

So from their side, the conversation sounded like this: "the company wants this, and the paperwork says we can do it." That is not a performance conversation. That is a verdict.

## The version that failed

I started with pressure.

"We are at risk on quarter commitments. Your delivery has been inconsistent. We need immediate improvement."

Technically true. Emotionally useless.

Then I moved to process language.

"We've already discussed this in prior 1:1s, and this conversation is now documented."

Also true. Still useless.

The engineer crossed their arms and said, "I don't understand what you want me to do differently."

At that moment I realized I had skipped the parts that made this human and specific. I had not explained what was happening to the team around them. I had not translated role expectations into observable actions. I had framed everything as institutional pressure and compliance risk.

I left that meeting with a signed plan and zero trust.

Two weeks later, performance had not improved enough, and the working relationship was worse.

That was the day the Four Bases stopped being an abstract model for me.

## The Four Bases

Before any difficult people decision, especially performance management, you need to pressure-test your rationale across four dimensions.

1. Team
2. Role
3. Business
4. Legal/Ethical

Most managers skip at least one. Almost everybody skips the one they find most uncomfortable.

- Avoid conflict? You skip Team and hide behind policy.
- Fear legal risk? You over-index on documentation and stop speaking plainly.
- Over-identify with execution pressure? You skip Role and treat every miss as interchangeable.
- Want to be liked? You skip Business and avoid decisions too long.

Your job is not to balance these perfectly every time. Your job is to know if any base is missing before you walk into the room.

## Base 1: Team

Performance is never only individual. It changes the load profile of everyone nearby.

When one person repeatedly misses handoffs, somebody else absorbs recovery work. That means late-night debugging, context switching, and resentment. If you fail to name that out loud, people conclude one of two things:

1. You do not see the impact.
2. You see it and accept it.

Neither interpretation is survivable.

The Team base requires concrete answers:

- What burden has shifted to others?
- What trust signals have been damaged?
- What happens to team norms if this pattern continues?

In my failed conversation, I used the word "team" once. I never described the actual burden transfer. I never told the engineer that two peers had quietly covered missed ownership twice in the same sprint. I thought that would feel accusatory, so I softened it away.

Softening made it less fair, not more fair.

## Base 2: Role

"Not meeting expectations" is lazy language unless you define expectations in behavior terms.

Role clarity means you can answer:

- Which responsibilities are currently unmet?
- What does good look like, specifically?
- How will we know this changed?

I had written "execution inconsistency" in my notes. That phrase means nothing in a live conversation.

A usable version sounds like this:

- "For this role, you own API handoff readiness by Tuesday noon. In the last six weeks, this missed three times."
- "For this role, you raise risk at least 48 hours before dependency deadlines. Last cycle, risk surfaced the day of handoff."
- "For this role, design decisions are documented before implementation. Two recent changes skipped that step and caused rework."

Role specificity lowers defensiveness because it removes guessing. The person may disagree with your assessment, but they no longer have to decode your vocabulary.

## Base 3: Business

Business rationale is necessary, but it should not be your opener in a performance conversation.

When managers start with business pressure, direct reports hear this as: "You are a delivery problem." That narrows the room. People defend identity before they absorb feedback.

You still need the Business base, because not every gap can be tolerated indefinitely. You should be able to explain:

- Which outcomes are at risk?
- Why timing matters now?
- What tradeoff you are making by intervening?

The sequence matters:

1. Team and Role for clarity and fairness.
2. Business for urgency and consequence.
3. Legal/Ethical for process integrity.

I used Business first because it was the easiest for me to say. It sounded objective. It also sounded impersonal.

## Base 4: Legal/Ethical

This base does not exist to threaten people. It exists to protect fairness and consistency.

Legal/Ethical means:

- Decisions are grounded in factual documentation.
- Expectations were communicated before penalties.
- Comparable cases were treated comparably.
- You are aligned with HR and local policy.

If you only speak this base, the conversation feels bureaucratic. If you skip this base, the conversation becomes risky and often unfair.

This is the tension: humane communication plus disciplined process.

Both are required.

## The pre-brief that changed my outcomes

After that failed meeting, I started doing a written pre-brief before every serious performance conversation. One page. No exceptions.

I fill this out the day before and review it with myself as if I am opposing counsel.

### Four Bases Decision Map

- Team:
  - What measurable burden shifted to peers?
  - What trust behavior changed?
- Role:
  - Which role expectations were missed?
  - What exact behavior must change?
- Business:
  - Which commitments are at risk?
  - What is the real cost of delay?
- Legal/Ethical:
  - What facts are documented?
  - Is the process consistent with similar cases?

Then I add two checks:

- Missing base check: which base is weakest in my prep?
- Empathy check: can I say this directly without dehumanizing the person?

If either fails, I do not run the conversation yet.

## Repairing a conversation you already handled badly

Sometimes you realize the problem after the fact, like I did.

You can still reset.

I scheduled a second meeting and opened like this:

"I handled our last conversation poorly. I focused on deadlines and process, and I did not clearly explain role expectations or team impact. I want to reset this with clearer specifics so you can decide what to do next with full context."

That sentence did three things:

1. Admitted my execution error.
2. Preserved accountability for performance issues.
3. Re-opened clarity without pretending the prior conversation did not happen.

Then I walked through the four bases in order.

### Team (what changed around you)

I described exactly where peers absorbed missed ownership and what that did to workload and planning trust.

### Role (what this job requires)

I mapped three responsibilities to recent examples and defined what changed behavior would look like over four weeks.

### Business (why timing matters)

I tied those expectations to a specific release sequence and dependency chain.

### Legal/Ethical (how process works)

I explained what had been documented, what the improvement plan required, and what outcomes were possible if change did not occur.

The second conversation was still hard. It was also clear.

Clarity does not guarantee a positive outcome. It guarantees the person understands the outcome path.

That is the minimum standard.

## What managers usually get wrong

### Mistake 1: Choosing one base as your personality

Some managers become "the empathetic one" and skip Business too long. Others become "the tough operator" and skip Team language entirely. Neither model scales.

### Mistake 2: Treating documentation as communication

A written warning is not a conversation. It is a record. The human understanding still has to happen live.

### Mistake 3: Confusing kindness with ambiguity

Ambiguity feels kind in the room and cruel in hindsight. If someone leaves unsure whether they are in serious risk, you failed.

### Mistake 4: Outsourcing courage to HR

HR is a partner, not a substitute for managerial clarity. If the person can explain your decision better than you can, you were not ready.

## Scripts that keep you out of trouble

These are not legal scripts. They are clarity scripts.

### Opening script

"I need to discuss your current performance against role expectations. I'll walk through team impact, role expectations, business implications, and what this means process-wise so nothing is ambiguous."

### Role-specific script

"In this role, one expectation is X by Y. In the last Z weeks, we saw A and B. The required change is C by date D."

### Support script

"This is the support you'll get: weekly checkpoints, explicit priorities, and documented feedback after each milestone."

### Consequence script

"If these changes are not sustained by the agreed checkpoints, next steps may include formal performance action up to role exit."

People hear consequences better when support is equally concrete.

## Applying the model to a mock case

If you are a new manager, test this on a fictional scenario before you need it live.

Case: A mid-level engineer repeatedly misses dependency handoffs.

- Team: two teammates are now carrying emergency patch work.
- Role: handoff readiness and proactive risk surfacing are role requirements.
- Business: release timeline has one buffer left.
- Legal/Ethical: feedback history exists; expectations documented; process aligned.

If you cannot complete one sentence per base, do not run the meeting.

## The emotional reality

No framework removes discomfort.

You will still feel like you are barely managing when another person's paycheck, confidence, and identity are in the room with you.

The point of the framework is not to make this easy. It is to make your judgment defendable, your communication clear, and your process fair.

That is what adults owe each other at work.

## Manager Action Checklist

- Write one sentence per base before every hard performance conversation.
- Gather at least two specific examples for Role and Team impact.
- Sequence the conversation: Team -> Role -> Business -> Legal/Ethical.
- State required behavior changes with a date and support plan.
- Document outcomes immediately after the conversation.
- If you handled a prior conversation poorly, own it explicitly and reset.
- Never rely on process language as a substitute for human clarity.


# Chapter 11: Telling Someone They're Not Getting Promoted

## Manager action checklist
- State decision clearly.
- Tie gaps to observable criteria.
- Set reassessment timeline.


# Chapter 12: The Firing Chapter (Yes, You Have to Read This One)

This chapter is not legal advice. It is a management chapter about how to do hard things clearly and humanely in partnership with HR and legal.

The call was scheduled for Thursday at 3:30 p.m.

I remember the time because the whole day became a countdown. If you've never had to fire someone, you might imagine the hard part is saying the sentence. The hard part starts earlier. The hard part is knowing this decision should happen, confirming it has to happen now, and then carrying it out without hiding behind theater.

A lot of managers fail here in one of two ways:

1. They delay too long because they confuse discomfort with compassion.
2. They execute too abruptly and pretend speed is professionalism.

Both create avoidable harm.

## Before the call: the decision threshold

A termination should not be a surprise to the person, even if the exact date is a surprise.

Before this call, we had:

- multiple documented feedback cycles,
- a formal performance plan,
- clear support commitments,
- missed milestones against that plan,
- HR and legal review for process compliance in the employee's jurisdiction.

Without those elements, you are likely not making a decision yet. You are still in the process of establishing whether a decision is justified.

Clarity on threshold matters because if you sound uncertain in the room, the conversation becomes argument, negotiation, and confusion.

This is not a negotiation meeting.

## The Four Bases for termination

Terminations are where managers either hide behind policy or over-index on emotion. The Four Bases keep the decision grounded.

### Team

- What ongoing burden is the team carrying?
- What trust and reliability standards are being affected?
- What happens if this continues for another quarter?

### Role

- Which expectations were repeatedly unmet?
- What support was provided?
- What objective milestones were not met?

### Business

- Why is continuation no longer viable for delivery and organizational goals?
- What are the downstream risks of further delay?

### Legal/Ethical

- Is the process compliant for this location and employment terms?
- Is documentation factual, consistent, and complete?
- Is the message humane and free of unnecessary detail or blame?

If one base is weak, do not schedule the call yet.

## Minute by minute: Thursday afternoon

### 2:45 p.m. - final prep

I reviewed the script with HR and confirmed logistics: access changes, severance details, and support resources. We aligned on who would speak when. We removed any language that sounded speculative.

I rewrote one sentence three times because it still sounded like a debate opener.

Bad version: "We've looked at a lot of factors and this has been difficult."

Better version: "We're ending your employment today."

You need to say it plainly in the first minute. Delayed clarity feels cruel.

### 3:20 p.m. - emotional calibration

I closed my laptop and did the thing managers rarely admit: I sat still for five minutes so I would not talk too much in the room.

When people are nervous, they over-explain. Over-explaining creates false hope.

Your job is to be clear, brief, and respectful.

### 3:30 p.m. - start

I joined the call with HR.

"Thanks for joining. I'll be direct. We're ending your employment with the company today. This decision is final."

Then pause.

People need a few seconds for language to land.

### 3:31 p.m. - rationale at the right altitude

I gave concise rationale tied to prior process:

"As we've discussed in prior reviews and the performance plan, required role expectations were not met by the final checkpoints."

No list of grievances. No courtroom recap. No moral judgment.

### 3:32 p.m. - logistics

HR covered logistics: final pay timing, severance terms, benefits window, and who to contact for follow-up questions.

This part needs precision. If you are vague here, you turn shock into panic.

### 3:35 p.m. - reaction space

The employee asked two direct questions and one emotional one.

- "Is there any appeal?"
- "Why now?"
- "Did you already decide this before our last check-in?"

Answers were short and truthful.

- "No, this decision is final."
- "Now, because the final milestones were not met and we reached the end of the plan timeline."
- "The decision point was tied to that final milestone review, which we completed this week."

No defensiveness. No hedging.

### 3:39 p.m. - close

I closed with dignity language:

"I know this is hard news. Thank you for the work you did here. HR will stay with you for next steps and support details."

Then I left the call so HR could continue logistics.

That sounds cold when written. In practice it protects everyone from improvised, risky, and often confusing conversation drift.

## What happened after the call

The call is only half the work.

### Team communication

You owe the team timely communication, but not private details.

I told the team same day:

- the person had left the company,
- ownership transitions for active work,
- where questions should go,
- no commentary on private employment details.

Say less than your anxiety wants you to say.

### Work redistribution

Terminations often reveal hidden single points of failure. We discovered one service area with only one practical owner. We reassigned coverage immediately and wrote down the lesson: no critical path should rely on one person without backup documentation.

### Manager aftermath

Managers often carry guilt, relief, doubt, and second-guessing at once.

You should debrief with HR and your manager, not with your team. The team needs stability, not your emotional processing.

## Common failure modes

### Failure mode 1: conversation opens with context, not decision

"We've had a tough quarter and there are many factors..." is a bad opening.

Clarity first. Context second.

### Failure mode 2: turning rationale into a legal transcript

You are not required to narrate every incident in the meeting. You are required to communicate the decision clearly and consistently.

### Failure mode 3: accidental negotiation language

Phrases like "I wish we could have found another way" invite bargaining if the decision is final.

Use language that matches reality.

### Failure mode 4: oversharing with the team afterward

Trying to prove fairness by sharing confidential details usually causes more harm.

### Failure mode 5: skipping the system fix

If a termination happens and nothing changes in how your team detects risk, you are setting up a repeat.

## A practical protocol: Dignity Exit Protocol

Use this as an operational checklist with HR/legal.

### Step 1: Confirm decision threshold

- documented expectations
- prior feedback cycles
- defined support actions
- final milestone outcomes
- legal and policy validation

### Step 2: Build the script

- decision sentence in line one
- concise rationale tied to prior process
- logistics handoff plan
- response boundaries for likely questions

### Step 3: Align roles in the meeting

- manager states decision and high-level rationale
- HR handles terms and process logistics
- no unplanned participants

### Step 4: Run team stabilization within 24 hours

- communicate departure respectfully
- define ownership transitions
- open channel for workflow questions
- protect confidentiality

### Step 5: Conduct manager debrief

- what worked in delivery
- where communication drifted
- what earlier interventions might have changed the outcome
- which team systems need redesign

## Ethical stance: dignity is operational, not decorative

People sometimes talk about dignity as tone. Tone matters, but dignity is mostly operational:

- no surprises without process,
- no ambiguity in the decision moment,
- no humiliation language,
- no confidential detail theater,
- no disappearance after the meeting.

Dignity is what your process does when stakes are high.

## If you are trying to avoid this chapter

Read it anyway.

The point is not to normalize firing. The point is to stop pretending it only happens to bad managers in bad companies.

Sometimes a role fit is not fixable in the available timeline. Sometimes you did everything right and the answer is still role exit. Sometimes you missed earlier signals and now you are making the least bad decision late.

In all cases, clarity and humanity are both mandatory.

That is what management is.

## Manager Action Checklist

- Confirm all four bases before scheduling a termination conversation.
- Partner with HR/legal on process, jurisdiction, and script boundaries.
- State the decision in the first minute and avoid delayed clarity.
- Keep rationale concise and tied to prior documented expectations.
- Hand off logistics cleanly and accurately.
- Communicate team changes quickly without confidential details.
- Debrief and implement one system fix to reduce repeat risk.
