# Overview

*Barely Managing* is a narrative-practical guide for early-career tech managers navigating the hardest parts of people leadership. It follows a leadership arc from high-support management training contexts to high-pressure scaling contexts where manager judgment, not institutional process, determines outcomes.

The book's core argument is simple: feeling like you are "barely managing" is common and useful. Rather than hiding uncertainty, managers should develop explicit frameworks that make hard decisions clear, fair, and defensible.

# Core Framework: The Four Bases

Before difficult people decisions, managers should validate four dimensions:

1. Team
2. Role
3. Business
4. Legal/Ethical

When one base is missing, conversations degrade into confusion, defensiveness, or avoidable risk.

# Reader Promise

By the end of this book, readers will be able to:

- run hard conversations with clearer preparation
- deliver no-promotion and performance decisions with dignity
- collaborate better with HR/legal without outsourcing leadership
- scale management practices across larger organizations

# Audience

- senior engineers evaluating management career paths
- experienced ICs seeking management context
- HR/People Ops partners in technical organizations

# Structure

- Part I: Becoming a Manager (Google Era)
- Part II: People Management Fundamentals (Google Era)
- Part III: Hard Conversations (Celonis Era)
- Part IV: Managing at Scale (Celonis Era)

Total chapters: 17

# Why This Book, Why Now

Technology organizations continue promoting strong ICs into management without sufficient training for high-stakes people decisions. Public leadership discourse over-indexes on culture and communication slogans while under-addressing scenarios managers most fear: underperformance, promotion denial, terminations, and structural uncertainty.

*Barely Managing* fills this gap with practical frameworks plus unvarnished case stories.

# Comparable Titles and Differentiation

- *The Manager's Path*: foundational management progression and structure.
- *An Elegant Puzzle*: organizational systems and leadership mechanics.
- *Radical Candor*: feedback philosophy and interpersonal clarity.

Differentiation: *Barely Managing* centers real decision narratives, Four Bases analysis, and operational scripts for hard management moments.
