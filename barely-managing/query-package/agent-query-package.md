Every manager eventually feels like they are barely managing. This book argues that feeling is not a defect to eliminate; it is a signal to manage with clearer frameworks, cleaner language, and stronger courage in hard conversations.

## Positioning and Differentiation

- Combines scene-level management stories with practical tools.
- Centers high-friction management moments often excluded from public leadership writing.
- Introduces the Four Bases framework for hard decisions:
  - Team
  - Role
  - Business
  - Legal/Ethical

## Target Audience

- senior ICs considering management
- experienced ICs who want better manager context
