# Query Letter Draft

Dear [Agent Name],

I am seeking representation for *Barely Managing*, a narrative management book for new and aspiring tech leaders. Complete at an estimated `68,000` words, it combines candid stories from engineering leadership at Google and Celonis with practical frameworks for high-stakes people decisions.

Most management books offer either abstract leadership theory or sanitized corporate advice. *Barely Managing* takes a different approach: scene-level stories paired with actionable tools managers can use immediately. Its central framework, **the Four Bases**, helps leaders pressure-test difficult decisions across Team, Role, Business, and Legal/Ethical dimensions before they walk into hard conversations.

The manuscript is structured in four parts across 17 chapters. Parts I and II cover the transition from individual contributor to manager and core people-management fundamentals in a high-support environment. Parts III and IV address harder realities: performance management, promotion denials, terminations, reorgs, and scaling leadership across large distributed organizations.

I am an engineering leader with experience at Google and Celonis. At Google, I worked on Ads forecasting and YouTube ads planning. At Celonis, I helped scale engineering leadership across approximately 70 teams and 400 engineers, including company-wide prioritization and management-system design for performance and promotions.

Comparable titles include *The Manager's Path* (Fournier), *An Elegant Puzzle* (Larson), and *Radical Candor* (Scott). *Barely Managing* differentiates through its unvarnished case studies, explicit decision frameworks, and practical treatment of conversations most managers avoid discussing publicly.

I have included a full proposal package with chapter synopses and two sample chapters: Chapter 10 (*Performance Problems and the Four Bases*) and Chapter 12 (*The Firing Chapter*).

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Ari Wilson
