# Barely Managing - Chapter Synopses

## Part I: Becoming a Manager (Google Era)

### Chapter 1 - The Offer You Can't Refuse (Or Can You?)
Ari takes a first management offer under social and organizational pressure and quickly learns that the title is easier than the role shift. The chapter breaks down the hidden costs of moving from IC to manager and introduces a decision framework for evaluating management opportunities before saying yes.

### Chapter 2 - Your First Week Is Already Too Late
An inherited delivery problem explodes during week one, showing why new managers who start with solutions get blindsided. This chapter offers a first-week listening and risk-mapping process that identifies trust gaps, delivery risks, and expectation mismatches before they become public failures.

### Chapter 3 - The Identity Crisis Nobody Warns You About
A senior engineer publicly challenges a new manager's technical judgment, forcing a painful identity shift from maker to multiplier. The chapter gives practical tactics for building credibility without pretending expertise and for managing high-seniority reports with fairness and confidence.

### Chapter 4 - What Big Tech Teaches You (And What It Hides)
Google's support systems absorb many early management mistakes, but that safety net can hide weak judgment. This chapter distinguishes portable management habits from environment-dependent ones and gives a method for rebuilding missing support systems when scaling in less structured companies.

## Part II: The Basics of People Management (Google Era)

### Chapter 5 - The 1:1 Is the Job
When a high performer disengages from low-quality 1:1s, Ari rebuilds the meeting format from scratch. The chapter reframes 1:1s as the core operating system of management and gives a repeatable agenda model that balances delivery, growth, and trust.

### Chapter 6 - Feedback That Doesn't Require HR Intervention
A vague feedback cycle ends in avoidable escalation. This chapter explains why specificity is a fairness tool, not a harshness tactic, and provides a practical model for delivering feedback early enough to prevent formal interventions whenever possible.

### Chapter 7 - Your First Promotion Packet
A promotion packet is rewritten dozens of times before passing calibration. Ari shows how advocacy, evidence selection, and role-level framing shape outcomes, then provides a structured method for building promotion cases that are rigorous and equitable.

### Chapter 8 - Hiring at Scale When You're Not the Bottleneck
As hiring grows, manager-centered processes start failing on speed and quality. This chapter outlines how to design interview loops, debrief standards, and panel accountability so hiring can scale without turning the manager into a throughput limiter.

## Part III: When Things Get Real (Celonis Era)

### Chapter 9 - The Conversation Nobody Trained You For
A first truly hard performance conversation exposes how little formal training most managers get for high-stakes feedback. The chapter introduces a pre-brief method that prepares managers to communicate clearly across team impact, role expectations, business pressure, and process fairness.

### Chapter 10 - Performance Problems and the Four Bases
Ari recounts a performance conversation that went badly because it covered business and legal defensibility but missed team and role clarity. The chapter introduces the Four Bases framework and gives scripts, failure patterns, and a decision map managers can use before any hard people decision.

### Chapter 11 - Telling Someone They're Not Getting Promoted
A manager explains a "not now" promotion decision while preserving dignity and trust. The chapter details how to separate personal value from level readiness, communicate criteria clearly, and pair disappointing outcomes with actionable growth contracts.

### Chapter 12 - The Firing Chapter (Yes, You Have to Read This One)
A minute-by-minute narrative of a termination conversation shows how to combine legal/process rigor with humane delivery. The chapter provides a practical protocol for preparation, messaging, logistics, team stabilization, and manager debrief after the decision.

### Chapter 13 - Layoffs, Reorgs, and Other Things That Aren't Your Fault But Are Your Problem
During organizational changes with incomplete information, managers must communicate clearly without pretending certainty. This chapter presents a known/unknown communication matrix and practical guidance for rebuilding trust and execution after structural disruption.

## Part IV: Managing at Scale (Celonis Era)

### Chapter 14 - The 70-Team Problem
As engineering scale grows, local optimization undermines overall throughput. Ari explains how to map dependency debt, redesign team boundaries, and shift governance from reporting hierarchy to value-stream execution.

### Chapter 15 - Prioritization as an Organizational Sport
With 220 active initiatives competing for resources, prioritization becomes performative and chaotic. The chapter introduces a shared decision model with explicit ownership, tie-breakers, and stopping rules that turn prioritization into an operating discipline.

### Chapter 16 - Technical Decisions When You're Not the Expert Anymore
Managers of managers must make technical decisions without deep hands-on authority in every domain. This chapter provides a decision-process ladder for balancing speed, reversibility, risk, and dissent while maintaining technical credibility.

### Chapter 17 - Building Culture That Survives You
Culture fails if it depends on a few charismatic leaders. In the final chapter, Ari shows how to convert values into repeatable behaviors, manager expectations, and measurable rituals so team culture endures leadership transitions.
