# Light Validation / Fact-Check Notes

## Validation Targets

- management population references used in chapter openers should be phrased qualitatively unless source-backed
- legal/process language in chapters 10-13 should avoid jurisdiction-specific claims without counsel review
- comparable title references should be publication-accurate in query materials

## Checks by Chapter

- ch10: verify any claim about policy/process sequence is generic and non-jurisdictional
- ch11: ensure promotion language avoids implied guarantees
- ch12: confirm termination process language remains principle-level, not legal instruction
- ch13: verify confidentiality language is principle-level and avoids overclaiming

## Pre-Submission Pass

Before sending agent package:
- run one line-edit pass for overconfident legal wording
- replace any accidental specific identifiers with generic descriptors
- confirm all chapter titles and part names are consistent across files
