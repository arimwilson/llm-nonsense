# Overview

*Barely Managing* is a practical guide for new and aspiring tech managers that breaks down the unspoken challenges of people leadership. The book traces a management journey from early lessons at Google, where the stakes felt high but the safety nets were real, to the messier, higher-impact reality of scaling engineering at Celonis, where managing 40+ engineers across 5 different countries meant confronting situations no training had prepared me for.

The title is intentional: every manager feels like they are barely managing at some point. This book argues that is not a bug; it is a feature. The goal is not to eliminate that feeling but to develop the frameworks, language, and courage to navigate it.

At its core, this is a book about hard conversations: the ones managers dread and companies often discourage. Not just how to give feedback, but how to tell someone they are not getting promoted, how to justify a role elimination to the person losing their job, and how to explain a reorg that does not make sense yet. Each conversation requires covering four dimensions: the team, the role, the business, and the legal/ethical ground you are standing on. Miss one, and the conversation falls apart.

# Target Audience

- New tech managers (0-3 years in role)
- Senior engineers considering the management track
- Experienced ICs who want to better understand their managers
- HR and People Ops professionals seeking engineering-specific context

# Unique Value Proposition

Most management books fall into two camps: abstract leadership theory or sanitized corporate advice. *Barely Managing* offers something different: raw, specific stories paired with actionable frameworks. Readers get the "what actually happened" alongside the "what I learned."

The book introduces a core framework for navigating hard conversations: **The Four Bases**. Before any difficult people decision, managers must be able to justify it across four dimensions:

1. **Team**: How does this serve the team's health and effectiveness?
2. **Role**: Is this the right call for this specific role and its requirements?
3. **Business**: Does this align with what the organization needs?
4. **Legal/Ethical**: Am I on solid ground? Could I defend this decision?

When managers skip a base, usually the uncomfortable one, conversations go sideways. The book teaches readers to pressure-test their thinking before they are in the room.

# Structure

The book alternates between **Anecdotes** (roughly 50%) and **Principles/Tools** (roughly 50%), organized into four parts. Parts I and II draw primarily from Google experiences: learning the basics with strong institutional support. Parts III and IV shift to Celonis, where the safety nets disappeared and real management began.

# Author Bio

Ari Wilson is an engineering leader with experience at Google and Celonis. At Google, they worked on Ads forecasting and YouTube ads planning, launching engineering offices and developer productivity initiatives. At Celonis, they scaled engineering leadership to manage approximately 70 teams and 400 engineers, leading company-wide prioritization efforts and developing systematic approaches to performance evaluation and promotion processes. They write about engineering management, occasionally make children's books, and still believe the best managers are the ones who admit they are figuring it out.

# Comparable Titles

- *The Manager's Path* by Camille Fournier
- *An Elegant Puzzle* by Will Larson
- *Radical Candor* by Kim Scott

*Barely Managing* differentiates itself through its emphasis on specific, unvarnished stories, its Four Bases framework for hard conversations, and its honest treatment of the decisions managers dread most.

# Estimated Length

60,000-75,000 words

# Next Steps

- [ ] Draft detailed chapter outlines
- [ ] Identify 15-20 core anecdotes and secure any necessary permissions
- [ ] Write sample chapter (recommend Chapter 10 or Chapter 12; these showcase the Four Bases framework and the book's unflinching tone)
- [ ] Research literary agents specializing in business/tech titles
