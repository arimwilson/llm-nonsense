# Chapter 10: Performance Problems and the Four Bases

I had the conversation backward.

I knew it while I was saying the words, but I kept talking anyway.

It was a Tuesday in late quarter. We were behind on two delivery commitments, and one engineer on my team had missed three critical handoffs in six weeks. I had notes. I had dates. I had escalation language from HR. I had a clean narrative for why we needed to act.

What I did not have was a complete case.

I had Business and Legal/Ethical in hand. I could explain deadlines, dependencies, and documented expectations. I could defend the process. I could prove we were not improvising.

I did not have Team and Role in a way the engineer could actually hear.

So from their side, the conversation sounded like this: "the company wants this, and the paperwork says we can do it." That is not a performance conversation. That is a verdict.

## The version that failed

I started with pressure.

"We are at risk on quarter commitments. Your delivery has been inconsistent. We need immediate improvement."

Technically true. Emotionally useless.

Then I moved to process language.

"We've already discussed this in prior 1:1s, and this conversation is now documented."

Also true. Still useless.

The engineer crossed their arms and said, "I don't understand what you want me to do differently."

At that moment I realized I had skipped the parts that made this human and specific. I had not explained what was happening to the team around them. I had not translated role expectations into observable actions. I had framed everything as institutional pressure and compliance risk.

I left that meeting with a signed plan and zero trust.

Two weeks later, performance had not improved enough, and the working relationship was worse.

That was the day the Four Bases stopped being an abstract model for me.

## The Four Bases

Before any difficult people decision, especially performance management, you need to pressure-test your rationale across four dimensions.

1. Team
2. Role
3. Business
4. Legal/Ethical

Most managers skip at least one. Almost everybody skips the one they find most uncomfortable.

- Avoid conflict? You skip Team and hide behind policy.
- Fear legal risk? You over-index on documentation and stop speaking plainly.
- Over-identify with execution pressure? You skip Role and treat every miss as interchangeable.
- Want to be liked? You skip Business and avoid decisions too long.

Your job is not to balance these perfectly every time. Your job is to know if any base is missing before you walk into the room.

## Base 1: Team

Performance is never only individual. It changes the load profile of everyone nearby.

When one person repeatedly misses handoffs, somebody else absorbs recovery work. That means late-night debugging, context switching, and resentment. If you fail to name that out loud, people conclude one of two things:

1. You do not see the impact.
2. You see it and accept it.

Neither interpretation is survivable.

The Team base requires concrete answers:

- What burden has shifted to others?
- What trust signals have been damaged?
- What happens to team norms if this pattern continues?

In my failed conversation, I used the word "team" once. I never described the actual burden transfer. I never told the engineer that two peers had quietly covered missed ownership twice in the same sprint. I thought that would feel accusatory, so I softened it away.

Softening made it less fair, not more fair.

## Base 2: Role

"Not meeting expectations" is lazy language unless you define expectations in behavior terms.

Role clarity means you can answer:

- Which responsibilities are currently unmet?
- What does good look like, specifically?
- How will we know this changed?

I had written "execution inconsistency" in my notes. That phrase means nothing in a live conversation.

A usable version sounds like this:

- "For this role, you own API handoff readiness by Tuesday noon. In the last six weeks, this missed three times."
- "For this role, you raise risk at least 48 hours before dependency deadlines. Last cycle, risk surfaced the day of handoff."
- "For this role, design decisions are documented before implementation. Two recent changes skipped that step and caused rework."

Role specificity lowers defensiveness because it removes guessing. The person may disagree with your assessment, but they no longer have to decode your vocabulary.

## Base 3: Business

Business rationale is necessary, but it should not be your opener in a performance conversation.

When managers start with business pressure, direct reports hear this as: "You are a delivery problem." That narrows the room. People defend identity before they absorb feedback.

You still need the Business base, because not every gap can be tolerated indefinitely. You should be able to explain:

- Which outcomes are at risk?
- Why timing matters now?
- What tradeoff you are making by intervening?

The sequence matters:

1. Team and Role for clarity and fairness.
2. Business for urgency and consequence.
3. Legal/Ethical for process integrity.

I used Business first because it was the easiest for me to say. It sounded objective. It also sounded impersonal.

## Base 4: Legal/Ethical

This base does not exist to threaten people. It exists to protect fairness and consistency.

Legal/Ethical means:

- Decisions are grounded in factual documentation.
- Expectations were communicated before penalties.
- Comparable cases were treated comparably.
- You are aligned with HR and local policy.

If you only speak this base, the conversation feels bureaucratic. If you skip this base, the conversation becomes risky and often unfair.

This is the tension: humane communication plus disciplined process.

Both are required.

## The pre-brief that changed my outcomes

After that failed meeting, I started doing a written pre-brief before every serious performance conversation. One page. No exceptions.

I fill this out the day before and review it with myself as if I am opposing counsel.

### Four Bases Decision Map

- Team:
  - What measurable burden shifted to peers?
  - What trust behavior changed?
- Role:
  - Which role expectations were missed?
  - What exact behavior must change?
- Business:
  - Which commitments are at risk?
  - What is the real cost of delay?
- Legal/Ethical:
  - What facts are documented?
  - Is the process consistent with similar cases?

Then I add two checks:

- Missing base check: which base is weakest in my prep?
- Empathy check: can I say this directly without dehumanizing the person?

If either fails, I do not run the conversation yet.

## Repairing a conversation you already handled badly

Sometimes you realize the problem after the fact, like I did.

You can still reset.

I scheduled a second meeting and opened like this:

"I handled our last conversation poorly. I focused on deadlines and process, and I did not clearly explain role expectations or team impact. I want to reset this with clearer specifics so you can decide what to do next with full context."

That sentence did three things:

1. Admitted my execution error.
2. Preserved accountability for performance issues.
3. Re-opened clarity without pretending the prior conversation did not happen.

Then I walked through the four bases in order.

### Team (what changed around you)

I described exactly where peers absorbed missed ownership and what that did to workload and planning trust.

### Role (what this job requires)

I mapped three responsibilities to recent examples and defined what changed behavior would look like over four weeks.

### Business (why timing matters)

I tied those expectations to a specific release sequence and dependency chain.

### Legal/Ethical (how process works)

I explained what had been documented, what the improvement plan required, and what outcomes were possible if change did not occur.

The second conversation was still hard. It was also clear.

Clarity does not guarantee a positive outcome. It guarantees the person understands the outcome path.

That is the minimum standard.

## What managers usually get wrong

### Mistake 1: Choosing one base as your personality

Some managers become "the empathetic one" and skip Business too long. Others become "the tough operator" and skip Team language entirely. Neither model scales.

### Mistake 2: Treating documentation as communication

A written warning is not a conversation. It is a record. The human understanding still has to happen live.

### Mistake 3: Confusing kindness with ambiguity

Ambiguity feels kind in the room and cruel in hindsight. If someone leaves unsure whether they are in serious risk, you failed.

### Mistake 4: Outsourcing courage to HR

HR is a partner, not a substitute for managerial clarity. If the person can explain your decision better than you can, you were not ready.

## Scripts that keep you out of trouble

These are not legal scripts. They are clarity scripts.

### Opening script

"I need to discuss your current performance against role expectations. I'll walk through team impact, role expectations, business implications, and what this means process-wise so nothing is ambiguous."

### Role-specific script

"In this role, one expectation is X by Y. In the last Z weeks, we saw A and B. The required change is C by date D."

### Support script

"This is the support you'll get: weekly checkpoints, explicit priorities, and documented feedback after each milestone."

### Consequence script

"If these changes are not sustained by the agreed checkpoints, next steps may include formal performance action up to role exit."

People hear consequences better when support is equally concrete.

## Applying the model to a mock case

If you are a new manager, test this on a fictional scenario before you need it live.

Case: A mid-level engineer repeatedly misses dependency handoffs.

- Team: two teammates are now carrying emergency patch work.
- Role: handoff readiness and proactive risk surfacing are role requirements.
- Business: release timeline has one buffer left.
- Legal/Ethical: feedback history exists; expectations documented; process aligned.

If you cannot complete one sentence per base, do not run the meeting.

## The emotional reality

No framework removes discomfort.

You will still feel like you are barely managing when another person's paycheck, confidence, and identity are in the room with you.

The point of the framework is not to make this easy. It is to make your judgment defendable, your communication clear, and your process fair.

That is what adults owe each other at work.

## Manager Action Checklist

- Write one sentence per base before every hard performance conversation.
- Gather at least two specific examples for Role and Team impact.
- Sequence the conversation: Team -> Role -> Business -> Legal/Ethical.
- State required behavior changes with a date and support plan.
- Document outcomes immediately after the conversation.
- If you handled a prior conversation poorly, own it explicitly and reset.
- Never rely on process language as a substitute for human clarity.
