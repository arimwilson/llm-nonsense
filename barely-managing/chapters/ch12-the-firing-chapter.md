# Chapter 12: The Firing Chapter (Yes, You Have to Read This One)

This chapter is not legal advice. It is a management chapter about how to do hard things clearly and humanely in partnership with HR and legal.

The call was scheduled for Thursday at 3:30 p.m.

I remember the time because the whole day became a countdown. If you've never had to fire someone, you might imagine the hard part is saying the sentence. The hard part starts earlier. The hard part is knowing this decision should happen, confirming it has to happen now, and then carrying it out without hiding behind theater.

A lot of managers fail here in one of two ways:

1. They delay too long because they confuse discomfort with compassion.
2. They execute too abruptly and pretend speed is professionalism.

Both create avoidable harm.

## Before the call: the decision threshold

A termination should not be a surprise to the person, even if the exact date is a surprise.

Before this call, we had:

- multiple documented feedback cycles,
- a formal performance plan,
- clear support commitments,
- missed milestones against that plan,
- HR and legal review for process compliance in the employee's jurisdiction.

Without those elements, you are likely not making a decision yet. You are still in the process of establishing whether a decision is justified.

Clarity on threshold matters because if you sound uncertain in the room, the conversation becomes argument, negotiation, and confusion.

This is not a negotiation meeting.

## The Four Bases for termination

Terminations are where managers either hide behind policy or over-index on emotion. The Four Bases keep the decision grounded.

### Team

- What ongoing burden is the team carrying?
- What trust and reliability standards are being affected?
- What happens if this continues for another quarter?

### Role

- Which expectations were repeatedly unmet?
- What support was provided?
- What objective milestones were not met?

### Business

- Why is continuation no longer viable for delivery and organizational goals?
- What are the downstream risks of further delay?

### Legal/Ethical

- Is the process compliant for this location and employment terms?
- Is documentation factual, consistent, and complete?
- Is the message humane and free of unnecessary detail or blame?

If one base is weak, do not schedule the call yet.

## Minute by minute: Thursday afternoon

### 2:45 p.m. - final prep

I reviewed the script with HR and confirmed logistics: access changes, severance details, and support resources. We aligned on who would speak when. We removed any language that sounded speculative.

I rewrote one sentence three times because it still sounded like a debate opener.

Bad version: "We've looked at a lot of factors and this has been difficult."

Better version: "We're ending your employment today."

You need to say it plainly in the first minute. Delayed clarity feels cruel.

### 3:20 p.m. - emotional calibration

I closed my laptop and did the thing managers rarely admit: I sat still for five minutes so I would not talk too much in the room.

When people are nervous, they over-explain. Over-explaining creates false hope.

Your job is to be clear, brief, and respectful.

### 3:30 p.m. - start

I joined the call with HR.

"Thanks for joining. I'll be direct. We're ending your employment with the company today. This decision is final."

Then pause.

People need a few seconds for language to land.

### 3:31 p.m. - rationale at the right altitude

I gave concise rationale tied to prior process:

"As we've discussed in prior reviews and the performance plan, required role expectations were not met by the final checkpoints."

No list of grievances. No courtroom recap. No moral judgment.

### 3:32 p.m. - logistics

HR covered logistics: final pay timing, severance terms, benefits window, and who to contact for follow-up questions.

This part needs precision. If you are vague here, you turn shock into panic.

### 3:35 p.m. - reaction space

The employee asked two direct questions and one emotional one.

- "Is there any appeal?"
- "Why now?"
- "Did you already decide this before our last check-in?"

Answers were short and truthful.

- "No, this decision is final."
- "Now, because the final milestones were not met and we reached the end of the plan timeline."
- "The decision point was tied to that final milestone review, which we completed this week."

No defensiveness. No hedging.

### 3:39 p.m. - close

I closed with dignity language:

"I know this is hard news. Thank you for the work you did here. HR will stay with you for next steps and support details."

Then I left the call so HR could continue logistics.

That sounds cold when written. In practice it protects everyone from improvised, risky, and often confusing conversation drift.

## What happened after the call

The call is only half the work.

### Team communication

You owe the team timely communication, but not private details.

I told the team same day:

- the person had left the company,
- ownership transitions for active work,
- where questions should go,
- no commentary on private employment details.

Say less than your anxiety wants you to say.

### Work redistribution

Terminations often reveal hidden single points of failure. We discovered one service area with only one practical owner. We reassigned coverage immediately and wrote down the lesson: no critical path should rely on one person without backup documentation.

### Manager aftermath

Managers often carry guilt, relief, doubt, and second-guessing at once.

You should debrief with HR and your manager, not with your team. The team needs stability, not your emotional processing.

## Common failure modes

### Failure mode 1: conversation opens with context, not decision

"We've had a tough quarter and there are many factors..." is a bad opening.

Clarity first. Context second.

### Failure mode 2: turning rationale into a legal transcript

You are not required to narrate every incident in the meeting. You are required to communicate the decision clearly and consistently.

### Failure mode 3: accidental negotiation language

Phrases like "I wish we could have found another way" invite bargaining if the decision is final.

Use language that matches reality.

### Failure mode 4: oversharing with the team afterward

Trying to prove fairness by sharing confidential details usually causes more harm.

### Failure mode 5: skipping the system fix

If a termination happens and nothing changes in how your team detects risk, you are setting up a repeat.

## A practical protocol: Dignity Exit Protocol

Use this as an operational checklist with HR/legal.

### Step 1: Confirm decision threshold

- documented expectations
- prior feedback cycles
- defined support actions
- final milestone outcomes
- legal and policy validation

### Step 2: Build the script

- decision sentence in line one
- concise rationale tied to prior process
- logistics handoff plan
- response boundaries for likely questions

### Step 3: Align roles in the meeting

- manager states decision and high-level rationale
- HR handles terms and process logistics
- no unplanned participants

### Step 4: Run team stabilization within 24 hours

- communicate departure respectfully
- define ownership transitions
- open channel for workflow questions
- protect confidentiality

### Step 5: Conduct manager debrief

- what worked in delivery
- where communication drifted
- what earlier interventions might have changed the outcome
- which team systems need redesign

## Ethical stance: dignity is operational, not decorative

People sometimes talk about dignity as tone. Tone matters, but dignity is mostly operational:

- no surprises without process,
- no ambiguity in the decision moment,
- no humiliation language,
- no confidential detail theater,
- no disappearance after the meeting.

Dignity is what your process does when stakes are high.

## If you are trying to avoid this chapter

Read it anyway.

The point is not to normalize firing. The point is to stop pretending it only happens to bad managers in bad companies.

Sometimes a role fit is not fixable in the available timeline. Sometimes you did everything right and the answer is still role exit. Sometimes you missed earlier signals and now you are making the least bad decision late.

In all cases, clarity and humanity are both mandatory.

That is what management is.

## Manager Action Checklist

- Confirm all four bases before scheduling a termination conversation.
- Partner with HR/legal on process, jurisdiction, and script boundaries.
- State the decision in the first minute and avoid delayed clarity.
- Keep rationale concise and tied to prior documented expectations.
- Hand off logistics cleanly and accurately.
- Communicate team changes quickly without confidential details.
- Debrief and implement one system fix to reduce repeat risk.
